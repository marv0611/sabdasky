# SABDA Immersive Visual Production Manual v12

## Purpose

Step-by-step process for creating immersive 3D visual scenes for the SABDA wellness studio. Any agent should be able to follow this manual to produce either a **single self-contained HTML file** for real-time browser rendering, or a **pre-rendered video pipeline** for reliable Watchout projection playback â€” without any server, build tools, or dependencies beyond the file itself.

This manual is parameterised. The architecture is universal. Only the **scene content** changes (butterflies, forest, underwater, rain, etc.). The pipeline, HTML structure, animation system, and delivery format are always identical.

This is v12. It incorporates all v8/v9/v10 content plus: **render-only HTML architecture** (separate from interactive viewer, 10-25× faster), **loop check renderer** (render_loopcheck.js for verifying loop continuity), **bird homing fix** (gentle radial nudge replaces aggressive heading-steering that caused circular orbits), **preview mode limitations** (dt/time mismatch documentation), and **commit discipline rule** (always commit working files immediately).

Previous v10 additions (all retained): Video loop continuity fixes (6 modifications ensuring seamless frame 0 to frame 1799 transitions for looped Watchout playback), and the GitHub-based file transfer workflow that eliminates context window exhaustion from large HTML uploads.

Previous v9 additions (all retained): Puppeteer video rendering pipeline, Watchout integration, MSAA/readPixels discovery, CRF 14 quality standard, preview/full mode.

Previous v8 additions (all retained): 8K sky, PNG format, HalfFloat cubemap, shader dithering, adaptive shadow lift, visual inspection protocol.

## ðŸš¨ ABSOLUTE RULE #1: Visual Pre-Delivery Inspection (MANDATORY)

**NEVER deliver a build without first rendering it and inspecting the output with your own eyes.**

This is not optional. This is not "when possible." This is MANDATORY for every single delivery. It will save hours of back-and-forth and broken builds.

### What This Means In Practice

Before presenting ANY HTML file to the user:

1. **Extract the visible wall band** from the sky texture (rows 30.8%-65.6% of equirectangular = the Â±34.5Â° to -28Â° elevation band the walls display)
2. **Apply the worst-case warmth tint** (coolest phase values) to simulate the darkest the scene will ever get
3. **Render a wall preview image** at wall proportions (5.76:1 aspect ratio)
4. **View the preview image** using the `view` tool â€” actually look at it
5. **Check for**: flat/featureless zones, dark muddy patches, visible banding, unnatural colour, any area that looks different from the rest
6. **Verify numerically**: 0% pixels below 50 brightness across all 8 azimuth columns at coolest tint
7. **Only then** assemble and deliver

### Why This Rule Exists

In the Belfast sky session, 6 consecutive builds were delivered without visual inspection. Each time the user reported the same pixelation issue. Each time the fix addressed numbers but not what the eye actually sees. When the agent finally used `view` to inspect the wall preview, the problem was immediately visible â€” a flat, featureless water patch that no amount of brightness lifting could fix. The texture noise solution was found in one iteration after visual inspection vs 6 failed iterations without it.

**Time saved by looking first: hours. Cost of not looking: trust.**

### The Visual Inspection Checklist

```
â–¡ Wall preview rendered at coolest tint phase
â–¡ Wall preview viewed with own eyes (view tool)
â–¡ No flat/featureless zones visible
â–¡ No dark muddy patches
â–¡ No visible colour banding
â–¡ Brightness verified: 0% pixels below 50 at coolest tint
â–¡ Local texture detail verified: minimum 0.5 std in 16Ã—16 blocks per column
â–¡ Preview looks consistent across full 360Â° panorama
```

If ANY check fails, DO NOT deliver. Fix first, re-inspect, then deliver.

## âš ï¸ GOLDEN RULE: The User's Perspective Is Everything

**Before committing any visual change, mentally stand inside the room and look around.**

30 people will be in this room. Some are 1 metre from the walls. Some are at the far end, 7.5 metres from the nearest wall. The visuals must look immersive, clean, and consistent from every position.

This means:
- No pixelation on close walls â€” resolution must survive close viewing
- No inconsistent lighting â€” if walls are dim, the floor must be dim. If walls are bright, the floor reflects that brightness
- No unnatural artifacts â€” shooting stars must behave like real meteors, not game effects
- No hotspots or bright patches that don't match what's on the walls
- Fog must be tuned so the far end of the room doesn't look washed out
- Every element must pass the "would this break the immersion?" test
- **No flat featureless zones** â€” every part of the visible wall band must have texture detail

**The standard is 10/10 or nothing.**

---

## âš ï¸ MANDATORY: Pre-Assembly Verification Protocol

**ALWAYS double-check the template before assembling.** Assembly takes time and requires the user to download and re-test. Catching errors before assembly saves entire iteration cycles.

### Before Every Assembly, Run This Check:

```bash
echo "=== VERIFY BEFORE ASSEMBLY ==="
echo "--- Resolution Pipeline ---"
grep "CUBE_SIZE\|STRIP_W\|setPixelRatio\|samples:\|HalfFloatType" template.html
echo "--- Sky Format ---"
grep "b64T.*skydata" template.html
echo "--- Warmth Tint ---"
grep "skyR =\|skyG =\|skyB =" template.html
echo "--- Dithering ---"
grep "dither" template.html
echo "--- Floor ---"
grep "0x787878\|floorMat\|roomAmbient\|roomHemi" template.html
echo "--- Shooting Stars ---"
grep "ssHead\|ssTail\|ss.timer\|ss.maxLife" template.html
echo "--- Fog ---"
grep "FogExp2" template.html
echo "--- Cycles ---"
grep "BREATH\|CCYCLE\|SKY_ROTATION_PERIOD\|skyPhase.*1800" template.html
echo "--- Planets ---"
grep "plAngle\|planetGroup.scale\|saturnMainGroup.scale" template.html
echo "--- Bloom ---"
grep "bloomPass\|UnrealBloomPass" template.html
echo "--- No Broken Shaders ---"
grep "attribute float uv" template.html && echo "âš ï¸ BROKEN SHADER FOUND" || echo "âœ“ Clean"
echo "--- No Floor PointLights ---"
grep "addGlow\|floorGlowY\|uplightColor" template.html && echo "âš ï¸ FLOOR POINTLIGHTS FOUND" || echo "âœ“ Clean"
```

### What to Verify:

1. **Visual inspection done** â€” wall preview rendered and viewed (see Absolute Rule #1)
2. **Resolution pipeline** â€” CubeCamera â‰¤ 2Ã— sky texture px/degree
3. **HalfFloat cubemap** â€” render target must use `THREE.HalfFloatType` to prevent banding
4. **Dithering shader** â€” equirect fragment shader must include dither function
5. **Sky format** â€” PNG for lossless quality (NOT JPEG)
6. **Warmth tint safe range** â€” minimum multipliers â‰¥ 0.85 R, â‰¥ 0.82 G
7. **Floor colour** â€” `#787878` medium grey, MeshStandardMaterial, NO PointLight hotspots
8. **Floor lighting consistency** â€” hemisphere + ambient only, both track wall brightness dynamically
9. **Shooting stars** â€” SphereGeometry head + CylinderGeometry tail (NOT custom shaders)
10. **Fog** â€” Content 0.003, Room 0.025 (tuned for 15m room depth)
11. **Cycles** â€” 14s breath, 90s colour, 1800s (30 min) sky rotation AND warmth
12. **No broken shaders** â€” `attribute float uv` in a ShaderMaterial will crash WebGL
13. **No floor PointLights** â€” these create inconsistent hotspots. Removed in v7.

## 1. What is SABDA

SABDA is a premium immersive wellness studio. Clients stand or sit inside a room where every wall is a continuous projection surface. The visuals wrap 360Â° around them. The goal is deep relaxation â€” not stimulation. Everything must feel natural, slow, meditative, alive.

### Physical Room Dimensions (CONFIRMED)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Length | **15.00 m** |
| Width | **5.63 m** |
| Height | **3.23 m** |
| Floor area | 84.45 mÂ² |
| Perimeter | 41.26 m |
| Shape | Rectangular (NOT square) |
| Class capacity | **30 people** |
| Closest viewing | **~1 metre from walls** |

âš ï¸ **CRITICAL:** The room is a **rectangle**, not a square. The room is nearly 3Ã— longer than it is wide. The two long walls (15m each) dominate the visual experience, while the two short walls (5.63m each) are narrow.

âš ï¸ **CLOSE VIEWING:** Classes host 30 people. Some will be within 1 metre of the walls. All rendering quality decisions must account for this.

### Wall Labelling System

Each wall has a tiny golden letter label at the top centre for reference:

```
        Wall A (short, 5.63m)
        â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”
        â”‚                     â”‚
Wall B  â”‚                     â”‚  Wall D
(long,  â”‚                     â”‚  (long,
15m)    â”‚                     â”‚  15m)
        â”‚                     â”‚
        â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
        Wall C (short, 5.63m)
```

Wall B = planet side. Wall D = Saturn side. Labels rendered as `rgba(196, 168, 130, 0.35)` â€” barely visible, reference only.

## 2. Scene Parameters (What Changes Per Scene)

Every SABDA scene uses the same HTML architecture. Only these elements change:

| Parameter | Example (Butterfly Dusk) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Sky HDRI | `belfast_sunset_puresky_8k.hdr` â†’ 8192Ã—4096 PNG |
| Animated creature | Butterfly FBX â†’ GLB |
| Creature texture(s) | Orange monarch + teal variant PNG |
| Background creatures | Eagle GLB flocks |
| Celestial body 1 | Fantasy planet GLB |
| Celestial body 2 | Saturn GLB |
| Colour palette | Warm amber / cool purple cycle |
| Shooting stars | Natural meteor streaks, ~1 per minute |

Everything else â€” the room, the rendering pipeline, the animation system, the breathing cycle â€” is identical across all scenes.

---

## 3. The Two Cycles: Sky Warmth + Colour Hue

SABDA classes run 60 minutes. The visual experience must evolve throughout without ever repeating noticeably. Two independent cycles create this:

### Sky Warmth Cycle (30 minutes â†’ 2 per hour)

Controls the overall mood of the sky â€” warm golden dusk â†” cool blue-purple twilight.

```javascript
const SKY_ROTATION_PERIOD = 1800;  // 30 minutes â€” sky rotates AND warms/cools
const skyPhase = (time / 1800) * Math.PI * 2;
const warmth = (Math.sin(skyPhase) + 1) / 2;  // 0 = coolest, 1 = warmest
```

In a 60-minute class, guests experience **2 full warmâ†’coolâ†’warm transitions**. This creates a living, breathing atmosphere without being perceptible moment-to-moment.

The warmth value controls:
- Sky sphere colour tint (warm gold â†” cool blue-purple)
- Sun intensity (dims in cool phase, brightens in warm)
- Star visibility (stars appear during cool phases)
- **Floor lighting intensity** (floor brightness tracks wall brightness)

âš ï¸ **WARMTH TINT SAFE RANGE (v8 CRITICAL):**
```javascript
// âœ“ CORRECT â€” gentle tint that never crushes dark areas
const skyR = 0.85 + warmth * 0.15;   // Range: 0.85â€“1.00
const skyG = 0.82 + warmth * 0.10;   // Range: 0.82â€“0.92
const skyB = 0.88 + (1 - warmth) * 0.12;  // Range: 0.88â€“1.00

// âœ— WRONG â€” old values that created pixelation in dark zones
const skyR = 0.75 + warmth * 0.25;   // Min 0.75 crushes dark pixels below 50
const skyG = 0.70 + warmth * 0.15;   // Min 0.70 is catastrophic for dark gradients
```

The old values (0.75/0.70 minimum) caused dark sky areas to drop below brightness 50 after tinting, which produces visible banding and posterization â€” especially on areas with low source texture detail. The new values (0.85/0.82 minimum) provide the same colour shift perception while keeping all pixel values in a safe range.

### Colour Hue Cycle (90 seconds)

Controls the accent colour that shifts through the lighting and atmospherics.

```javascript
const CCYCLE = 90;  // Full hue rotation every 90 seconds
const hue = (time / CCYCLE) % 1;
colT.setHSL(hue, 0.45, 0.45);
colC.lerp(colT, 0.004);  // Smooth interpolation
```

### Breathing Cycle (14 seconds)

Subtle luminance pulse that makes the scene feel alive:

```javascript
const BREATH = 14;
const br = t => (Math.sin(t * Math.PI * 2 / BREATH - Math.PI / 2) + 1) / 2;
```

### Why These Numbers

| Cycle | Period | Per 60-min class | Purpose |
|-------|--------|------------------|---------|
| Breathing | 14s | ~257 cycles | Subliminal "aliveness" |
| Colour hue | 90s | ~40 rotations | Colour richness |
| Sky warmth | 1800s (30 min) | 2 full cycles | Mood evolution |
| Sky rotation | 1800s (30 min) | 2 full rotations | Cloud/star drift |

## 4. Resolution Pipeline â€” Preventing Pixelation

### The Problem

The content scene renders through a chain: Sky texture â†’ Sky sphere â†’ CubeCamera â†’ Equirect shader â†’ Strip texture â†’ Wall planes. Each step can introduce pixelation if the resolution doesn't match.

### The Rule: CubeCamera Resolution Must Not Exceed Sky Texture Resolution

For an 8K sky (8192Ã—4096 equirectangular) = **~22 pixels per degree**.

| CubeCamera size | Pixels per degree | vs 8K Sky | Result |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| 4096 | 45.5 | 2Ã— oversample | **Correct** â€” matches sky density with filtering |
| 2048 | 22.7 | 1:1 match | Acceptable fallback |
| 1024 | 11.4 | 0.5Ã— undersample | Mobile only |

âš ï¸ **CRITICAL LESSON (v7/v8):** CubeCamera resolution must be calibrated to the sky texture. For a 4K sky, use 2048 CubeCamera. For an 8K sky, use 4096 CubeCamera. Going above 2Ã— source px/degree makes individual pixels visible instead of smooth.

### Current Settings (v8 â€” 8K Sky)

```javascript
const CUBE_SIZE = isMobile ? 1024 : 4096;      // Matches 8K sky texture density
const STRIP_W_VAL = isMobile ? 4096 : 12288;   // Strip for wall texture
const STRIP_H = Math.round(STRIP_W / 5.76);    // Aspect ratio from room perimeter
const MSAA_SAMPLES = isMobile ? 4 : 8;         // Anti-aliasing on strip
```

### If You Change the Sky Texture Resolution

| Sky texture | CubeCamera | Strip width |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 4096Ã—2048 | 2048 | 8192 |
| 8192Ã—4096 | 4096 | 12288 |

Always match: `CubeCamera px/degree â‰¤ 2Ã— Sky texture px/degree`

---

## 5. Sky Texture Processing â€” The Full Pipeline (v8)

### Source Format

Sky HDRIs are sourced from Poly Haven or similar at 8K resolution (8192Ã—4096). Pure sky versions (no ground) are preferred.

### Tonemapping from HDR

```python
# ACES filmic tonemapping
def aces(x):
    a, b, c, d, e = 2.51, 0.03, 2.43, 0.59, 0.14
    return np.clip((x * (a * x + b)) / (x * (c * x + d) + e), 0, 1)

exposed = hdr_image * 0.15  # Exposure multiplier
mapped = aces(exposed)
ldr = (mapped * 255).astype(np.uint8)
```

### Adaptive Shadow Lift (v8 â€” CRITICAL)

Many HDRIs have dark, featureless areas below the horizon (calm water, flat ground). On a wall viewed from 1-3 metres, these become visible flat slabs. Apply a brightness-adaptive shadow lift:

```python
# Per-pixel adaptive lift â€” stronger in darker areas, barely touches brights
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY).astype(float) / 255.0
bright_map = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (201, 201), 50)
lift_map = np.clip(0.28 - bright_map * 0.30, 0.04, 0.28)

for c in range(3):
    channel = img[:,:,c]
    img[:,:,c] = channel + lift_map * (1.0 - channel)**2
```

This lifts shadows proportionally â€” dark areas (brightness ~0.2) get strong lift (~0.22), while bright areas (brightness ~0.8) get minimal lift (~0.04). The quadratic curve `(1-x)Â²` ensures highlights are untouched.

### Procedural Texture Noise for Flat Zones (v8 â€” CRITICAL)

After shadow lift, check local texture detail. Areas with local std < 2.0 in 16Ã—16 blocks are essentially flat colour and will look like slabs on the wall. Add subtle procedural noise:

```python
# Detect flat areas
local_std = compute_local_std(gray, kernel=61)
flat_mask = np.clip((2.0 - local_std) / 1.5, 0, 1)

# Multi-octave noise for natural cloud-like texture
noise = sum(
    cv2.resize(np.random.randn(h//s, w//s), (w, h)) * (s / 256.0)
    for s in [64, 128, 256]
)
noise = noise / noise.std()

# Apply only to flat areas at low amplitude (Â±4 out of 255)
for c in range(3):
    img[:,:,c] += noise * flat_mask * 4.0
```

### Output Format: PNG (NOT JPEG)

âš ï¸ **ALWAYS use PNG for sky textures.** JPEG creates 8Ã—8 block compression artifacts that are especially visible in dark gradient areas. Analysis showed 2Ã— worse gradient discontinuities at JPEG block boundaries in dark zones. PNG is lossless and eliminates this entirely.

```javascript
// âœ“ CORRECT
const skyTex = b64T('skydata', 'image/png');

// âœ— WRONG â€” JPEG block artifacts visible in dark sky gradients
const skyTex = b64T('skydata', 'image/jpeg');
```

File size impact: PNG sky textures are 9-15 MB base64 vs 2-3 MB for JPEG. The quality difference is non-negotiable at SABDA standard.

### Sky Quality Verification Script

Run this before building to verify a sky texture passes quality thresholds:

```python
import cv2, numpy as np

img = cv2.imread('sky_8k.png')
h, w = img.shape[:2]
mid = h // 2

# Simulate coolest warmth tint
tinted = img.astype(float)
tinted[:,:,2] *= 0.85  # R channel (BGR order)
tinted[:,:,1] *= 0.82  # G channel
tinted = np.clip(tinted, 0, 255).astype('uint8')

# Extract visible wall band
vis_top, vis_bot = int(h * 0.308), int(h * 0.656)
wall = tinted[vis_top:vis_bot]
gray = cv2.cvtColor(wall, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Check per-column (8 azimuth segments)
n, cw = 8, w // 8
for i in range(n):
    col = gray[:, i*cw:(i+1)*cw]
    below_50 = (col < 50).sum() / col.size * 100
    print(f'Col {i}: mean={col.mean():.0f}, min={col.min()}, <50: {below_50:.1f}%')
    assert below_50 == 0, f'FAIL: Column {i} has {below_50:.1f}% pixels below 50'

# Check local detail in below-horizon area
below_hz = cv2.cvtColor(img[mid:vis_bot], cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
for i in range(n):
    col = below_hz[:, i*cw:(i+1)*cw]
    local_stds = [col[y:y+16, x:x+16].std()
                  for y in range(0, col.shape[0]-16, 16)
                  for x in range(0, col.shape[1]-16, 16)]
    detail = np.mean(local_stds)
    print(f'Col {i} detail: {detail:.1f}')
    assert detail >= 0.5, f'FAIL: Column {i} detail {detail:.1f} < 0.5 â€” needs texture noise'

print('ALL CHECKS PASSED')
```

## 6. Render Pipeline Anti-Banding System (v8)

### The Problem: 8-Bit Colour Banding

When the warmth tint multiplies dark pixel values (e.g., 70 Ã— 0.82 = 57.4), adjacent source values map to the same output value. In flat gradient areas, this creates visible bands â€” entire rows of identical brightness with sudden jumps. On a 3-metre wall viewed from 2 metres, these bands are visible.

### Solution 1: HalfFloat Cubemap Render Target

The CubeCamera render target must use 16-bit floating point instead of the default 8-bit. This preserves full precision during the tint multiply, preventing banding at the intermediate step.

```javascript
// âœ“ CORRECT â€” 16-bit precision prevents banding
const cubeRT = new THREE.WebGLCubeRenderTarget(CUBE_SIZE, {
  generateMipmaps: true,
  minFilter: THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter,
  type: THREE.HalfFloatType,
});

// âœ— WRONG â€” default 8-bit causes banding in dark gradients after tint
const cubeRT = new THREE.WebGLCubeRenderTarget(CUBE_SIZE, {
  generateMipmaps: true,
  minFilter: THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter,
});
```

### Solution 2: Dithering in the Equirect Shader

Add Â±0.5 LSB random noise in the equirectangular fragment shader. This breaks up any remaining 8-bit banding on the final output. Standard technique from professional film/TV colour grading.

```glsl
precision highp float;
uniform samplerCube tCube;
uniform float vFovRad;
uniform float elevOffset;
varying vec2 vUv;

// Dithering: breaks up 8-bit colour banding in dark gradients
float dither(vec2 co) {
  return fract(sin(dot(co, vec2(12.9898, 78.233))) * 43758.5453) - 0.5;
}

void main() {
  float azimuth = vUv.x * 6.283185307;
  float elevation = (vUv.y - 0.5) * vFovRad + elevOffset;
  float ce = cos(elevation);
  vec3 dir = vec3(sin(azimuth) * ce, sin(elevation), -cos(azimuth) * ce);
  vec4 col = textureCube(tCube, dir);
  // Add Â±0.5 LSB dithering noise â€” invisible but eliminates banding
  col.rgb += dither(gl_FragCoord.xy) / 255.0;
  gl_FragColor = col;
}
```

### Why Both Solutions Together

- **HalfFloat cubemap** prevents banding during the intermediate CubeCamera capture step (tint Ã— texture â†’ cubemap)
- **Dithering** prevents banding during the final equirect â†’ strip â†’ wall output step
- Together they eliminate banding at every stage of the pipeline

## 7. Floor Lighting â€” The Consistency Rule

### The Rule

**The floor must always be consistent with the walls.** If the walls show a dim cool purple sky, the floor must not have warm bright spots. If the walls show a bright golden sunset, the floor should be softly lit with warm spill.

### What NOT to Do (v6 mistake, fixed in v7)

```javascript
// âœ— WRONG â€” PointLights create hotspots independent of wall content
addGlow(ROOM_W/2 - 0.5, 0.4, z, 0.5);  // Bright warm spot near wall
```

PointLights on the floor create visible hotspots that don't correlate with what's showing on the walls. When the sky is cool purple, these warm spots look completely wrong.

### What to Do (v7)

```javascript
// âœ“ CORRECT â€” hemisphere + ambient only, both track wall brightness
const roomAmbient = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xaaa0a0, 0.3);
const roomHemi = new THREE.HemisphereLight(0xc09070, 0x080810, 0.5);

// In animation loop:
const wallBrightness = (0.3 + warmth * 0.7) * glowBreath;
roomHemi.color.setRGB(0.65 * tR * glowBreath, 0.50 * tG * glowBreath, 0.40 * tB * glowBreath);
roomHemi.intensity = 0.45 * wallBrightness;
roomAmbient.intensity = 0.15 + wallBrightness * 0.2;
```

### Floor Material

```javascript
const floorMat = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0x787878,          // Medium grey â€” matches real SABDA vinyl
  map: vinylTex,            // Subtle noise texture for realism
  roughness: 0.75,          // Matte vinyl with hint of sheen
  metalness: 0.05,
  envMap: cubeRT.texture,   // Ghost of sky reflection
  envMapIntensity: 0.08,    // Barely there
});
```

---

## 8. Shooting Star System (v11.5)

### Architecture: World-Space Shader Quads on Sky Dome

Shooting stars are rendered as a single 6-vertex PlaneBufferGeometry with a custom ShaderMaterial. The head and tail positions are calculated each frame and written directly to vertex positions in world space. The quad is billboarded toward the camera using a cross product of the velocity direction and camera direction.

**Critical design: meteors follow the sky dome curvature.** A straight-line velocity would fly the meteor off the sphere into empty space — invisible to the viewer. Instead, the meteor's position is re-projected onto the dome surface each frame (`pos.normalize().multiplyScalar(340)`), and the tail is placed via Rodrigues rotation along the sphere.

### Tail Length: Angular Arc on Dome

Tail length is defined as an angular arc on the sky dome, NOT a linear distance:

```javascript
const tailAngle = 0.2 + ss.tailBonus * 0.003;
// normal: 0.2-0.35 rad (12-20 degrees)
// giant:  0.8-2.0 rad (46-115 degrees)
```

Using Rodrigues rotation to place the tail point:
```javascript
const cosA = Math.cos(tailAngle), sinA = Math.sin(tailAngle);
const tail = head.clone().multiplyScalar(cosA)
  .add(rotAxis.clone().cross(head).multiplyScalar(sinA))
  .add(rotAxis.clone().multiplyScalar(rotAxis.dot(head) * (1 - cosA)));
```

### 50/50 Size Mix

Half of shooting stars are modest streaks, half are giant wall-crossers:

```javascript
const isGiant = Math.random() > 0.5;
ss.tailBonus = isGiant ? 200 + Math.random() * 400 : Math.random() * 50;
ss.maxLife = isGiant ? 4.0 + Math.random() * 2.0 : 2.0 + Math.random() * 1.0;
```

- **Normal** (50%): 12-20 degree arc, 2-3 seconds — fills part of one wall
- **Giants** (50%): 46-115 degree arc, 4-6 seconds — sweeps across walls, exploiting the 360 degree room

### Entry Angle and Travel Direction

```javascript
const entryAngle = (2 + Math.random() * 5) * Math.PI / 180;  // 2-7 degrees from horizontal
const travelTheta = sTheta + 0.4 + Math.random() * 0.6;      // Wide diagonal sweep
const speed = 120 + Math.random() * 80;                        // 120-200 varied pace
```

Shallow 2-7 degree entry creates nearly horizontal sweeps that cross from one wall to the next — leveraging the 360 degree projection for maximum immersion.

### Production Frequency

```javascript
ss.timer = 25 + Math.random() * 10;  // 25-35s between stars (avg 30s)
```

For testing, set `ss.timer = 0` for back-to-back rapid fire.

### Common Mistakes with Shooting Stars

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Straight-line velocity | Meteor flies off dome into empty space, becomes invisible | Re-project onto dome each frame: `pos.normalize().multiplyScalar(340)` |
| Linear tail length (pixels) | Tail goes through sphere interior, not visible | Use angular arc with Rodrigues rotation |
| Sphere + Cylinder geometry | Looks like a game effect, not a natural meteor | Shader quad with head-to-tail gradient |
| Steep entry (>20 degrees) | Looks like objects falling, not meteors | Keep 2-7 degrees from horizontal |
| Fixed tail length | All meteors look identical | 50/50 mix of normal/giant with per-spawn randomness |
| Spawning isGiant after maxLife | isGiant is undefined, crashes render loop | Always declare variables before use |

## 8a. Bird System (v11.5)

### Flight Physics

Birds use simple spring-based physics with several layers of correction:

**Horizontal movement:**
```javascript
bd.heading += bd.turnRate;
bd.ctr.position.x += Math.sin(bd.heading) * bd.cruiseSpeed * dt * 30;
bd.ctr.position.z += Math.cos(bd.heading) * bd.cruiseSpeed * dt * 30;
```

**Vertical movement** — spring toward target altitude:
```javascript
const alt = bd.homeY + (bd.isGliding ? -0.3 : 0.2);
bd.vy += (alt - bd.ctr.position.y) * 0.02 * dt;
bd.vy *= Math.pow(0.96, dt * 30);  // damping — dt-scaled!
bd.ctr.position.y += bd.vy;
```

### Home-Pull Steering

Birds naturally drift. A gentle home-pull kicks in when they stray too far:

```javascript
if (dist > bd.homeDist + 5) {
  const tc = Math.atan2(-pz, -px);
  let hd = tc - bd.heading;
  // normalize angle...
  btb = hd * 0.004 * (1 + Math.min(1, (dist - bd.homeDist - 5) * 0.03) * 2);
}
```

**Critical: turn rate must scale with timeScale.** At 30x timelapse, the bird moves 30x faster per frame but can only turn a fixed amount. The turn rate clamp must scale:

```javascript
const maxTurn = 0.012 * dt * 30;  // scales with speed
bd.turnRate = Math.max(-maxTurn, Math.min(maxTurn, bd.turnRate));
```

Without this, birds escape the scene at high speed because they can't steer fast enough.

### Hard Boundary (Safety Net)

If a bird reaches dist > 40 despite the home-pull (common at 30x timelapse), teleport it back to its home orbit:

```javascript
if (dist > 40) {
  const a = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
  bd.ctr.position.x = Math.cos(a) * bd.homeDist;
  bd.ctr.position.z = Math.sin(a) * bd.homeDist;
  bd.heading = a + Math.PI / 2 + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.5;
}
```

At dist > 40, birds are offscreen — the teleport is invisible.

### Model Direction Fix

The bird GLB model's visual forward direction is ambiguous. From far away, backward-flying birds look fine. From close up, the head is visibly facing the wrong way.

**Solution: flip close birds 180 degrees, leave far birds as-is, smooth blend in between:**

```javascript
const flipBlend = Math.min(1, Math.max(0, (dist - 22) / 6));
bd.ctr.rotation.y = bd.heading + Math.PI * (1 - flipBlend);
// dist <= 22: +PI (faces forward), dist >= 28: +0 (keep backward look)
```

### Organic Flapping

Mechanical flapping is the number one immersion-breaker for birds. Several techniques make it natural:

1. **Slow transitions** (0.4 lerp rate, not 1.5) — wings ease in and out like breathing
2. **Varied glide speed** (0.15-0.35 timeScale, not fixed 0.35) — each bird glides differently
3. **Sinusoidal modulation** — continuous subtle wave on flap speed, unique per bird:
   ```javascript
   const flapWave = 1.0 + Math.sin(time * (0.8 + bd._fadeOffset * 0.3)) * 0.12;
   ```
4. **Longer cycles** — 3-7 second glide/flap durations (not 1.5-5) for lazier rhythm

### 30-Minute Loop Transition

Birds fade out in the last 12 seconds and fade in during the first 12 seconds, staggered per bird (~1.5s offset each):

```javascript
const loopFadeDur = 10;
const stagger = bd._fadeOffset * 1.2;  // 0, 1.56, 3.12, 4.68, 6.24, 7.8
```

While invisible, each bird resets to its deterministic spawn position. The first 12 seconds of every loop look identical. Mid-loop flight paths are randomized (natural behavior) but start/end are always the same.

### Altitude Safety Layers

| Layer | Range | Behavior |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Spring target | homeY +/- 0.3/0.2 | Normal oscillation |
| Soft push | 2.8 / 6.5 | Gentle correction |
| Hard backstop | 2.0 / 7.5 | Absolute clamp |
| Velocity clamp | +/-0.15 | Prevents runaway |

### Common Bird Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Turn rate not dt-scaled | Birds escape at timelapse — maxTurn = 0.012 * dt * 30 |
| Home-pull too aggressive | Birds whip around in tight U-turns — use 0.004 base, not 0.015 |
| Heading snap at boundary | Birds jitter at edge — teleport to home orbit instead |
| Physics running while invisible | Velocity accumulates, bird shoots off on fade-in — freeze physics when birdFade < 0.01 |
| Fixed fade for all birds | Synchronized pop — stagger 1.5s per bird |
| Respawn at homeY + 3 | Visible drop on entry — respawn at homeY |
| Damping not dt-scaled | Different behavior at different frame rates — use Math.pow(0.96, dt * 30) |

## 9. Room Fog â€” Tuned for 15m Depth

```javascript
contentScene.fog = new THREE.FogExp2(0x9a7a90, 0.003);  // Atmospheric haze
roomScene.fog = new THREE.FogExp2(0x0a0808, 0.025);      // Subtle depth
```

| Distance | Room fog (0.025) | What's there |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| 2.8m | 7% | Short wall from centre |
| 7.5m | 18% | Long wall from centre |
| 15m | 33% | Far wall from near wall |

## 10. The 360Â° Equirectangular Rendering System

### Pipeline Overview

Content scene â†’ CubeCamera (6 faces) â†’ Equirect shader (with dithering) â†’ Strip texture â†’ 4 wall planes

### Three Render Passes, Different Tonemapping Each

```javascript
// Step 1: Content â†’ cube faces (WITH tonemapping)
renderer.toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping;
cubeCamera.update(renderer, contentScene);

// Step 2: Cube â†’ equirect strip (NO tonemapping)
renderer.toneMapping = THREE.NoToneMapping;
renderer.setRenderTarget(stripRT);
renderer.render(equirectScene, equirectCamera);
renderer.setRenderTarget(null);

// Step 3: Room â†’ screen with bloom (NO tonemapping)
renderer.toneMapping = THREE.NoToneMapping;
bloomComposer.render();
```

### Bloom Post-Processing

```javascript
const bloomPass = new UnrealBloomPass(
  new THREE.Vector2(innerWidth, innerHeight),
  0.15,    // Strength â€” barely perceptible cinematic touch
  0.6,     // Radius â€” soft spread
  0.85     // Threshold â€” only brightest areas (planets, horizon)
);
```

## 11. Quality & Design Philosophy

**SABDA is a world-class premium immersive space. The visuals must match.**

### Non-Negotiable Quality Rules

1. **10/10 or nothing** â€” every element must pass the "would this break immersion?" test
2. **Visually inspect before delivering** â€” use `view` tool on wall previews. MANDATORY. (See Absolute Rule #1)
3. **User perspective first** â€” mentally stand inside the room before committing changes
4. **Resolution must match source** â€” CubeCamera â‰¤ 2Ã— sky texture px/degree
5. **Floor matches walls** â€” no inconsistent lighting, ever
6. **Natural phenomena only** â€” shooting stars, birds, butterflies must behave realistically
7. **No visible artifacts** â€” pixelation, banding, hotspots, seams, flat zones, shader errors
8. **Test from multiple positions** â€” near wall, centre, far end
9. **Fog tuned for room depth** â€” 15m is a long room
10. **Maximum quality from source assets** â€” one excellent HDRI beats clever processing tricks
11. **Fix surgically** â€” when something is broken, change ONE thing. Don't redesign.
12. **Numbers lie, eyes don't** â€” a metric can pass while the visual fails. Always look.

### The "Less is More" Principle

From the v3 visual audit: subtle effects compound. When you reduce glow, emissive, fog, bloom, and particles each by a small amount, the combined result is dramatically cleaner. Always start subtle and add, never start heavy and reduce.

## 13. Common Mistakes & Fixes (v7 + v8 Additions)

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Delivering without visual inspection** | **ALWAYS render wall preview and view it before delivering. Absolute Rule #1.** |
| **JPEG sky texture** | **Use PNG. JPEG block artifacts are visible in dark sky gradients at 2Ã— magnification.** |
| **8-bit cubemap render target** | **Use `THREE.HalfFloatType`. Default 8-bit causes banding after warmth tint multiply.** |
| **No dithering in equirect shader** | **Add Â±0.5 LSB dither noise. Eliminates final-stage 8-bit banding.** |
| **Warmth tint too aggressive (R=0.75, G=0.70)** | **Use Râ‰¥0.85, Gâ‰¥0.82 minimum. Old values crush dark areas below brightness 50.** |
| **Flat featureless below-horizon zones** | **Add procedural texture noise to areas with local std < 2.0. Invisible but prevents flat slabs.** |
| **Shadow lift applied uniformly** | **Use per-pixel adaptive lift based on local brightness. Dark areas get more, bright areas barely touched.** |
| **Dual-sphere sky approach for crossfade** | **Use single sphere + shader crossfade. Two 8K textures = 256MB VRAM + lag.** |
| **CubeCamera 2048 with 8K sky** | **Use 4096 for 8K sky. 2048 undersamples, losing detail.** |
| **Trusting brightness numbers alone** | **Numbers can pass while the visual fails. ALWAYS inspect with eyes. A local std of 0.4 "passes" numerically but looks like a flat slab.** |
| **Floor PointLights creating hotspots** | **Remove ALL floor PointLights. Use hemisphere + ambient only, both tracking wallBrightness.** |
| **Custom shader with `attribute float uv`** | **NEVER use `attribute float uv` in ShaderMaterial â€” conflicts with Three.js internals.** |
| **Shooting star using Points geometry** | **Use SphereGeometry head + CylinderGeometry tail. Points are sub-pixel at 300m.** |
| **Floor too dark (#303030)** | **Use #787878. Floor reads darker than expected in dim room lighting.** |
| **Room fog too strong (0.04)** | **Use 0.025 for 15m room. 0.04 creates 45% attenuation at far wall.** |
| **MeshBasicMaterial for floor** | **Use MeshStandardMaterial to receive hemisphere/ambient light properly.** |
| **MSAA on render targets used for gl.readPixels** | **Remove `samples` parameter from WebGLRenderTarget. MSAA render targets return all-black (zeros) when read with gl.readPixels in WebGL. This is a WebGL limitation, not a bug.** |
| **Using canvasHandle.screenshot() for video rendering** | **Use gl.readPixels + OffscreenCanvas JPEG instead. Screenshot approach encodes PNG internally, making it 20× slower (6s/frame vs 0.22s/frame).** |
| **Not testing preview mode before full render** | **ALWAYS run preview first (30× speed, 60s output, ~7 min). A full 30-min render takes 3+ hours — discovering a bug at frame 40,000 wastes an entire afternoon.** |
| **CRF 18 for projected content with subtle gradients** | **Use CRF 14. CRF 18 introduces visible banding in sky gradients and particle trails when projected on 15m walls. 50% larger files, non-negotiable quality.** |
| **JPEG quality <0.95 for frame capture** | **Use JPEG 0.98 for readPixels frame encoding. Lower quality introduces compression artifacts in sky gradients that compound with video codec compression.** |
| **HalfFloatType on wall render targets for video** | **Use UnsignedByteType for render targets that feed gl.readPixels. HalfFloat data needs conversion before readPixels can use it, and the video pipeline already handles 8-bit output.** |
| **Running full render without checking first frame** | **The video pipeline should output a test frame first. If it’s black, MSAA is likely still enabled on the render target.** |

## 15. HDRI Selection Criteria (v8)

Not all HDRIs work well for SABDA. The below-horizon content is critical because it occupies the lower 40% of the visible wall band and is viewed from close range.

### Must-Have Properties

| Property | Threshold | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Resolution | â‰¥ 8192Ã—4096 | Close viewing on 15m walls |
| Below-horizon brightness | Mean â‰¥ 80 per column at coolest tint | Prevents dark banding |
| Below-horizon local detail | â‰¥ 0.5 std in 16Ã—16 blocks | Prevents flat slabs |
| Format | HDR/EXR (true HDR data) | Needed for proper tonemapping |
| Content | Pure sky preferred | Ground content often problematic |

### Red Flags in HDRIs

- **Calm water** â€” creates flat, featureless reflections that look like colour slabs on walls
- **Dark ground at one azimuth** â€” creates a visible dead zone on one wall
- **Very high dynamic range at horizon** â€” ACES tonemapping may crush adjacent areas
- **Strong ground features** â€” buildings, trees, roads look bizarre as immersive projection

### Comparison: Good vs Problematic HDRI

| Property | Evening Road 01 (âœ“ Good) | Belfast Sunset (âš ï¸ Needed fixes) |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Below-horizon detail | 0.7-1.4 (cloud reflections) | 0.4 (flat water, columns 0-2) |
| Below-horizon brightness | min 67 at cool tint | min 33 before fix |
| Fix required | Mild shadow lift only | Adaptive lift + texture noise |

---

## 16. Dual-Sky Crossfade Architecture (v8)

For scenes that transition between two skies over the warmth cycle:

### âœ— WRONG: Dual Sphere Approach

```javascript
// Two sky spheres with transparency blending
// FAILS â€” 2Ã— 8K textures = 256MB VRAM, lag, double cloud stacking
const skyA = new THREE.Mesh(geo, new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texA, transparent: true }));
const skyB = new THREE.Mesh(geo, new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texB, transparent: true }));
```

### âœ“ CORRECT: Single Sphere + Shader Crossfade

```javascript
const skySphereMat = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    texA: { value: skyTexA },
    texB: { value: skyTexB },
    mixVal: { value: 0.0 },
    tintColor: { value: new THREE.Color(1,1,1) }
  },
  fragmentShader: `
    uniform sampler2D texA, texB;
    uniform float mixVal;
    uniform vec3 tintColor;
    varying vec2 vUv;
    void main() {
      vec4 a = texture2D(texA, vUv);
      vec4 b = texture2D(texB, vUv);
      gl_FragColor = vec4(mix(a.rgb, b.rgb, mixVal) * tintColor, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  side: THREE.BackSide
});

// In animation loop:
skySphereMat.uniforms.mixVal.value = 1.0 - warmth;  // warmth=1 â†’ sky A, warmth=0 â†’ sky B
```

This uses a single sphere with a custom shader that mixes two textures on the GPU. Negligible performance cost compared to the dual-sphere approach.

## 17. Video Rendering Pipeline for Watchout (v9)

### Why Pre-Rendered Video

Live HTML rendering through Chromium as a Watchout input works for development and testing, but pre-rendered video is the production standard because:

1. **Guaranteed frame consistency** — no dropped frames, no GPU throttling, no browser garbage collection pauses
2. **Watchout native playback** — video files are Watchout’s primary media type, with robust timeline control
3. **Repeatable output** — identical playback every time, unlike live rendering which varies with system load
4. **Offline preparation** — render overnight, load into Watchout the next day, test at leisure

### Architecture Overview

```
Scene HTML → Puppeteer (headless Chrome) → Manual frame control
    → gl.readPixels (4 wall targets) → Vertical flip → OffscreenCanvas JPEG 0.98
    → Base64 → Node.js → Buffer → FFmpeg stdin (4 parallel processes)
    → 4 wall videos → hstack merge → sabda_top.mp4 + sabda_bottom.mp4
```

### HTML Scene Requirements

The HTML file must expose a manual frame control function for Puppeteer to call:

```javascript
// Add to the HTML scene (outside the animation loop)
window.SABDA_RENDER_FRAME = function(time) {
  // Advance all animations to the given time
  updateScene(time);       // Sky rotation, warmth, colour cycle, breathing
  updateCreatures(time);   // Birds, butterflies
  updateCelestials(time);  // Planets, shooting stars
  
  // Render all passes
  renderer.toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping;
  cubeCamera.update(renderer, contentScene);
  renderer.toneMapping = THREE.NoToneMapping;
  renderer.setRenderTarget(stripRT);
  renderer.render(equirectScene, equirectCamera);
  renderer.setRenderTarget(null);
  bloomComposer.render();
  
  // Render each wall to its own render target
  for (const wall of walls) {
    renderer.setRenderTarget(wall.renderTarget);
    renderer.render(roomScene, wall.camera);
    renderer.setRenderTarget(null);
  }
};
```

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Wall Render Target Configuration for Video

Wall render targets used for gl.readPixels **MUST NOT** use MSAA. This is the single most important lesson from the video pipeline development:

```javascript
// ✓ CORRECT — No MSAA, UnsignedByte for readPixels compatibility
const wallRT = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(width, height, {
  minFilter: THREE.LinearFilter,
  magFilter: THREE.LinearFilter,
  format: THREE.RGBAFormat,
  type: THREE.UnsignedByteType,  // NOT HalfFloatType
  // NO samples parameter — MSAA breaks readPixels
});

// ✗ WRONG — MSAA render target returns all-black via readPixels
const wallRT = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(width, height, {
  samples: 4,  // THIS CAUSES BLACK OUTPUT
  type: THREE.HalfFloatType,  // Incompatible with readPixels for video
});
```

**Why this happens:** In WebGL, MSAA render targets use multisampled storage that cannot be directly read by `gl.readPixels`. The call succeeds (no error) but returns an array of zeros — producing completely black frames. This is a WebGL specification limitation, not a Three.js bug.

**Note:** The content scene’s CubeCamera render target should still use HalfFloatType for banding prevention (see Section 6). Only the wall render targets that feed the video pipeline need UnsignedByteType without MSAA.

### Wall Render Target Dimensions

| Wall | Real size | Render target | Projectors |
|------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Left (B) | 15.00m | 5008×1200 | 2.6 projectors |
| Right (D) | 15.00m | 5008×1200 | 2.6 projectors |
| Front (A) | 5.63m | 1920×1200 | 1 projector |
| Back (C) | 5.63m | 1920×1200 | 1 projector |
| **Total** | **41.26m** | **6928×1200 per strip** | **8 projectors** |

### render.js — The Rendering Script

Core parameters:

```javascript
const MODE = 'preview';           // 'preview' or 'full'
const FPS = 30;
const DURATION_SEC = 1800;        // 30 minutes (one warmth cycle)
const PREVIEW_SPEED = 30;         // 30× speed for preview mode
const JPEG_QUALITY = 0.98;        // High quality frame capture
const CRF = '14';                 // FFmpeg quality (lower = better)
const PRESET_WALLS = 'medium';    // FFmpeg encoding speed for walls
const PRESET_MERGE = 'slow';      // FFmpeg encoding speed for final merge
const VIEWPORT_W = 6928;          // Total width
const VIEWPORT_H = 2400;          // Total height (2 strips of 1200)
```

### Frame Capture Process (Per Frame)

```javascript
// 1. Advance scene to target time
await page.evaluate((t) => window.SABDA_RENDER_FRAME(t), frameTime);

// 2. Read pixels from each wall render target
const pixelData = await page.evaluate((wallIndex) => {
  const gl = renderer.getContext();
  const rt = walls[wallIndex].renderTarget;
  const w = rt.width, h = rt.height;
  const pixels = new Uint8Array(w * h * 4);
  
  renderer.setRenderTarget(rt);
  gl.readPixels(0, 0, w, h, gl.RGBA, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, pixels);
  renderer.setRenderTarget(null);
  
  // Vertical flip (WebGL reads bottom-up)
  const flipped = new Uint8Array(w * h * 4);
  const rowSize = w * 4;
  for (let y = 0; y < h; y++) {
    flipped.set(
      pixels.subarray((h - 1 - y) * rowSize, (h - y) * rowSize),
      y * rowSize
    );
  }
  
  // Encode as JPEG via OffscreenCanvas
  const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(w, h);
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  const imgData = new ImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(flipped.buffer), w, h);
  ctx.putImageData(imgData, 0, 0);
  const blob = await canvas.convertToBlob({ type: 'image/jpeg', quality: 0.98 });
  const reader = new FileReader();
  return new Promise(r => {
    reader.onload = () => r(reader.result.split(',')[1]);  // base64
    reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
  });
}, wallIndex);

// 3. Send to FFmpeg stdin
const buffer = Buffer.from(pixelData, 'base64');
ffmpegProcess.stdin.write(buffer);
```

### FFmpeg Configuration

Each wall gets its own FFmpeg process receiving JPEG frames via stdin:

```bash
ffmpeg -y -f image2pipe -framerate 30 -i pipe:0 \
  -c:v libx264 -crf 14 -preset medium \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart \
  wall_left.mp4
```

Final merge into two horizontal strips:

```bash
# Top strip: Left + Front = 6928×1200
ffmpeg -y -i wall_left.mp4 -i wall_front.mp4 \
  -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2" \
  -c:v libx264 -crf 14 -preset slow \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart \
  sabda_top.mp4

# Bottom strip: Right + Back = 6928×1200
ffmpeg -y -i wall_right.mp4 -i wall_back.mp4 \
  -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2" \
  -c:v libx264 -crf 14 -preset slow \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart \
  sabda_bottom.mp4
```

### Preview vs Full Mode

| Parameter | Preview | Full |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Speed | 30× real-time | 1× real-time |
| Frames | 1,800 | 54,000 |
| Output duration | 60 seconds | 30 minutes |
| Render time | ~7 minutes | ~3.3 hours |
| Purpose | Validate pipeline, check visuals | Production delivery |

**ALWAYS run preview mode first.** A 7-minute preview catches all pipeline issues, visual bugs, and encoding problems before committing to a 3+ hour full render.

### Quality Settings Rationale

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| JPEG quality | 0.98 | Frame capture fidelity. Lower values introduce artifacts in sky gradients that compound with video compression |
| CRF | 14 | Video compression quality. CRF 18 produces visible banding in subtle sky gradients when projected on 15m walls. CRF 14 is 50-70% larger but preserves all detail |
| Preset (walls) | medium | Balance of speed and quality for individual wall encoding |
| Preset (merge) | slow | Final output quality — worth the extra time since it only runs once |
| Codec | H.264 MP4 | Universal Watchout compatibility. Switch to HAP Q only if playback issues occur |

### Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Frame render time | 0.22–0.25s per frame |
| Bottleneck | Base64 transfer (readPixels → JPEG → base64 → Node.js) |
| Preview render | ~7 minutes for 1,800 frames |
| Full render | ~3.3 hours for 54,000 frames |
| Output file size | ~2–3 GB per 30-minute strip at CRF 14 |

cd ~/Documents/GitHub/sabda
python3 assemble_evening.py

# 2. Live browser preview (check crossfade, loop boundary)
open sabda_evening_render_full.html
# Use time scrub slider at bottom — drag to 22:30 for pure Belfast, 7:30 for pure Evening
# Scrub to 29:52→0:08 to verify bird fade and planet loop

# 3. Preview render (always first — 60s output, ~10 min)
node render.js

# 4. Check output visually
open output/sabda_top.mp4
open output/sabda_bottom.mp4
# Verify: no black frames, correct colours, smooth animation, no artifacts

# 5. Full production render (30min output, ~5 hours)
node render.js full

# 6. Load into Watchout (see Section 18)
```

## 17a. Video Loop Continuity Fixes (v10)

### The Problem

The 30-minute video (1800 seconds) loops in Watchout for 60-minute classes. Mathematical cycles (sky rotation, warmth, colour hue) align perfectly at t=1800. But **stateful animated elements** accumulate drift that creates a visible jump at the loop point:

| Element | Why It Breaks | Severity |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Bird positions | Continuous heading drift via `heading += turnRate * dt` | High - visible position jump |
| Dust particles | Random drift + respawn, accumulates state | Medium - numerous but tiny |
| Planet rotations | `rotation.y += dt * rate` never completes full cycles | Medium - visible orientation jump |
| Shooting stars | Random timer, may be mid-streak at t=1799 | High - bright streak appears/vanishes |
| Colour lerp (colC) | `colC.lerp(colT, 0.004)` accumulates state | Low - subtle colour shift |

### The 6 Fixes (All Applied to sabda_evening_render.html)

#### Fix 1: Planet Rotations — Time-Absolute, Full Revolutions

Replace incremental rotation with time-absolute rotation that completes exact full cycles:

```javascript
// BEFORE (incremental - accumulates, never aligns)
planetGroup.rotation.y += dt * 0.006;
saturnGroup.rotation.y += dt * 0.003;
saturnMainGroup.rotation.y += dt * 0.0015;

// AFTER (time-absolute - exact full revolutions per 1800s)
planetGroup.rotation.y = (time / 1800) * Math.PI * 2 * 2;      // 2 full rotations
saturnGroup.rotation.y = (time / 1800) * Math.PI * 2 * 1;      // 1 full rotation
saturnMainGroup.rotation.y = (time / 1800) * Math.PI * 2 * 1;  // 1 full rotation
```

#### Fix 2: Shooting Star Suppression Near Loop Boundary

Suppress new shooting stars in the last 15 seconds and first 2 seconds of each 1800s cycle:

```javascript
const loopT = time % 1800;
if (ss.timer <= 0 && loopT > 2 && loopT < 1785) {
    // spawn new shooting star
}
```

This prevents a bright streak being visible at the loop cut point.

#### Fix 3: Bird Homing (Last 30s + First 30s)

Birds gently steer toward their spawn positions near loop boundaries:

```javascript
const birdLoopT = time % 1800;
const birdResetBlend = birdLoopT < 30 ? 1 - birdLoopT / 30 
                     : birdLoopT > 1770 ? (birdLoopT - 1770) / 30 
                     : 0;

// During homing window, blend toward initial orbit angle
if (birdResetBlend > 0) {
    const homeAngle = flock._initAngle + (time / 1800) * Math.PI * 2;
    const angleDiff = homeAngle - currentAngle;
    heading += angleDiff * birdResetBlend * 0.05;  // 5% per frame, gentle
}
```

Requires storing initial angle at spawn: `_initAngle: fc.angle` in the flock object.

#### Fix 4: Dust Particle Homing (Last 20s + First 20s)

Dust particles pull toward deterministic positions seeded by their index:

```javascript
const dustLoopT = time % 1800;
const dustResetBlend = dustLoopT < 20 ? 1 - dustLoopT / 20 
                     : dustLoopT > 1780 ? (dustLoopT - 1780) / 20 
                     : 0;

if (dustResetBlend > 0) {
    // Pull toward seeded initial position
    const homeX = (seededRandom(i * 3) - 0.5) * spread;
    pos.x += (homeX - pos.x) * dustResetBlend * 0.03;  // 3% per frame
}
```

#### Fix 5: Colour Lerp Reset (Last 5s)

Reset the accumulated colC lerp toward its initial value:

```javascript
const colLoopT = time % 1800;
if (colLoopT > 1795) {
    const resetFactor = (colLoopT - 1795) / 5;
    colC.lerp(new THREE.Color(0.7, 0.5, 0.4), resetFactor * 0.02);
}
```

#### Fix 6: Store Bird Initial Angles

Each bird flock must store its spawn angle for the homing calculation:

```javascript
birdFlocks.push({ ctr, mixer, action, heading, _initAngle: fc.angle, ... });
```

### What Naturally Aligns (No Fix Needed)

| Cycle | Period | Cycles in 1800s | Remainder |
|-------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Sky rotation | 1800s | 1.00 | 0 |
| Sky warmth | 60s | 30.00 | 0 |
| Colour hue | 90s | 20.00 | 0 |
| Breathing | 14s | 128.57 | 8s offset |

Breathing has a slight misalignment but it's a subliminal luminance pulse of only 6% — invisible at the loop point.

### Testing Loop Continuity

After rendering, verify by:
1. Opening the preview video in VLC
2. Setting loop playback (right-click > Loop)
3. Watching the loop point repeatedly
4. Checking: no bird position jumps, no shooting star flashes, no planet orientation snaps, no dust cloud shifts

## 18. Watchout Integration — Video Workflow (v9)

### Stage Layout

The Watchout stage uses 8 projectors arranged in 2 rows of 4:

```
Watchout Stage: 7680×2400
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  sabda_top.mp4 (6928×1200)      │  │  Y=40
│  │  Left Wall  |  Front Wall      │  │
│  │  5008×1200  |  1920×1200       │  │
│  └────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  sabda_bottom.mp4 (6928×1200)   │  │  Y=1506
│  │  Right Wall |  Back Wall       │  │
│  │  5008×1200  |  1920×1200       │  │
│  └────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
X=92
```

### Watchout Positioning

| Media | Position | Size |
|-------|----------|------|
| sabda_top.mp4 | X=92, Y=40 | 6928×1200 |
| sabda_bottom.mp4 | X=92, Y=1506 | 6928×1200 |

The X=92 offset centres the 6928-wide content within the 7680-wide stage. The Y positions place each strip at the correct row of projectors with a 266px gap between rows (accounting for projector bezels/overlap).

### Projector Mapping

```
Top row (Y=0–1200):
  Proj 1: 0–1920      Proj 2: 1920–3840    Proj 3: 3840–5760    Proj 4: 5760–7680

Bottom row (Y=1200–2400):
  Proj 5: 0–1920      Proj 6: 1920–3840    Proj 7: 3840–5760    Proj 8: 5760–7680
```

### Looping Strategy

The 30-minute video covers exactly one full sky warmth cycle (1800 seconds). For a 60-minute class, loop the video twice. Because the warmth cycle is sinusoidal, the transition from end to start is seamless — both are at the same warmth phase.

### Watchout Setup Steps

1. Import `sabda_top.mp4` and `sabda_bottom.mp4` as media
2. Add both to the timeline at the same start time
3. Position top strip at X=92, Y=40
4. Position bottom strip at X=92, Y=1506
5. Set both to loop (timeline duration = class duration)
6. Test on all 8 projectors — verify wall boundaries align with physical corners

### Alternative: Live HTML via Chromium

For development and testing, Watchout can use Chromium as a live input source:

```
HTML → Chromium (6928×2400) → Spout feed → Watchout input → NDI → 8 projectors
```

This is useful for real-time parameter tweaking but should NOT be used for production classes due to the risk of frame drops, garbage collection pauses, and GPU throttling.

### Codec Upgrade Path

Start with H.264 MP4 (CRF 14). If Watchout shows any of these symptoms, switch to HAP Q:

- Frame drops during playback
- Visible decompression artifacts at projector boundaries
- Seek/loop transition stuttering

HAP Q uses GPU-accelerated decompression but produces much larger files (~10×). Only switch if H.264 proves insufficient.

## 19. Preview System — 360° Room Viewer (v12.4)

The preview HTML (`sabda_*_full.html`) includes a built-in 360° room simulator and speed controls. This is the **default preview method** for all SABDA visuals going forward.

### Build & Preview
```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/sabda && git pull && python3 assemble_murmuration.py && open sabda_murmuration_full.html
```

### Keyboard Controls

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| **R** | Toggle 360° room view (4 walls, floor, ceiling — orbit with mouse drag) |
| **Y** | Toggle 5× speed (amber indicator) |
| **T** | Toggle 30× speed (red indicator) |
| **D** | Toggle guide overlays (wall labels, dividers) |
| **P** | Cycle projector strip views (both / top only / bottom only) |
| **⏸ button** | Pause / play |
| **Slider** | Scrub timeline (0–1800s) |

### 360° Room View (R key)

Renders the scene onto 4 walls matching the SABDA room geometry:
- Room dimensions: 15.00m (long walls B, D) × 5.63m (short walls A, C) × 3.23m (ceiling height)
- Camera at eye height (1.6m), exact center of room
- Orbit controls: drag to look around, no pan, no zoom
- Floor: matte dark gray (non-reflective)
- Ceiling: dark

The room viewer uses the **same cubemap and post-processing pipeline** as the strip renderer:
- Same equirect projection shader (S-curve 0.50, saturation 1.30, highlight ceiling 0.90)
- Rendered to intermediate sRGB render target, then blitted to screen (matches strip path exactly)
- `NoToneMapping` on final output (same as strip view)

**This ensures the room view matches exactly what will appear on the projectors.** Any color or brightness difference between room view and strip view is a bug.

### Strip View (default)

The default view shows two horizontal strips:
- Top strip: Left wall B (5008px) + Front wall C (1920px) = 6928×1200
- Bottom strip: Right wall D (5008px) + Back wall A (1920px) = 6928×1200

This matches the Watchout stage layout (see Section 18).

### Speed Controls

- **1× (default)**: real-time playback, seconds tick 1:1 with wall clock
- **5× (Y key)**: preview 30 minutes in 6 minutes — good for checking flow and timing
- **30× (T key)**: preview 30 minutes in 60 seconds — good for checking loop seam and overall arc

Timer uses `performance.now()` for accurate real-time tracking regardless of frame rate.

## 20. Lessons Learned Log (v8 + v9 + v10 + v11 + v12 Additions)

Building on all v7 lessons (1-30), v8 adds lessons 31-42, v9 adds lessons 43-49, v10 adds lessons 50-52, v11 adds lessons 53-59, v11.1 adds 61-74, v11.5 adds 75-86, v12 adds 87-108, v12.1 adds 109-118 (murmuration).

31. **(v8) ALWAYS visually inspect before delivering.** Six consecutive builds were delivered and rejected because the agent trusted numbers without looking. The moment the agent used `view` to inspect the wall preview, the problem (flat featureless water patch) was immediately visible. Visual inspection would have caught this on build #1 and saved hours. This is now Absolute Rule #1.

32. **(v8) JPEG creates visible block artifacts in dark sky gradients.** Analysis showed 2Ã— worse gradient discontinuities at 8Ã—8 block boundaries in dark zones compared to bright zones. PNG eliminates this entirely. The file size increase (2MB â†’ 12MB) is non-negotiable for SABDA quality.

33. **(v8) 8-bit cubemap render targets cause banding after warmth tint.** When MeshBasicMaterial's color multiplies dark texture values, the result gets quantised to 8-bit in the default cubemap. HalfFloatType preserves 16-bit precision through the pipeline.

34. **(v8) Shader dithering eliminates final-stage banding.** Adding Â±0.5 LSB random noise in the equirect fragment shader is a standard film/TV colour grading technique. Invisible at viewing distance, completely eliminates visible colour steps in smooth gradients.

35. **(v8) Warmth tint minimum values must stay above 0.82.** The old coolest-phase tint (R=0.75, G=0.70) pushed dark sky areas below brightness 50, creating visible posterization. The new range (Râ‰¥0.85, Gâ‰¥0.82) provides perceptible colour shift without darkness-related artifacts.

36. **(v8) Below-horizon HDRI content quality varies wildly.** Some HDRIs have detailed cloud reflections below the horizon (Evening Road: detail 0.7-1.4). Others have flat calm water (Belfast: detail 0.3-0.4). On a wall at 1-3m viewing distance, flat areas become visible colour slabs. Always check per-column local detail before selecting an HDRI.

37. **(v8) Adaptive shadow lift beats uniform lift.** A uniform shadow lift brightens everything equally, washing out naturally bright areas. Per-pixel adaptive lift (stronger where darker, weaker where brighter) raises problematic areas without touching good ones. Use a Gaussian-blurred brightness map to drive the lift amount.

38. **(v8) Procedural texture noise rescues flat zones.** When an HDRI has genuinely featureless content (calm water, flat ground), no amount of brightness adjustment adds visual detail. Multi-octave procedural noise (scales 64/128/256) applied only to flat areas (local std < 2.0) at Â±4/255 amplitude creates invisible but effective texture that prevents the flat-slab appearance.

39. **(v8) Dual-sphere sky crossfade is a performance trap.** Two 8K textures with transparency compositing = 256MB VRAM + visible lag. A single sphere with a custom shader mixing two textures on the GPU achieves the same visual result at negligible performance cost.

40. **(v8) CubeCamera 2048 undersamples an 8K sky.** When the sky was upgraded from 4K to 8K, the CubeCamera should have been upgraded from 2048 to 4096 to match. 2048 on an 8K sky loses detail that's visible on close walls. Always recalibrate the full pipeline when changing sky resolution.

41. **(v8) Numbers lie, eyes don't.** A sky texture can pass all brightness thresholds (mean > 80, min > 50, 0% below threshold) while still looking terrible because of flat featureless content. The Qwantani sky had local detail of 0.3 in some areas â€” worse than Belfast's 0.4 â€” but was rated 8.5/10 because the overall composition worked. Metrics are necessary but not sufficient. Visual inspection is the final gate.

42. **(v8) Fix the root cause, not the symptom.** The Belfast pixelation went through 10 attempted fixes: reverting to single sky, downscaling to 4K, darkening below horizon, brightening below horizon, mirroring hemispheres, aggressive shadow removal. None worked because none addressed the root cause (low-detail water content + aggressive tint darkening + 8-bit banding). Finding the root cause required stepping back and analysing the full pipeline, not iterating on symptoms.

### v9 Additions: Video Rendering Pipeline

43. **(v9) MSAA render targets return black pixels via gl.readPixels.** This is a WebGL specification limitation — multisampled render target storage cannot be directly read. The gl.readPixels call succeeds without error but returns an array of zeros, producing completely black frames. Remove the `samples` parameter from any WebGLRenderTarget that needs pixel readback. This cost multiple debugging hours because the failure is silent — no error, no warning, just black output.

44. **(v9) Screenshot-based rendering (canvasHandle.screenshot()) is 20× slower than direct readPixels.** The Puppeteer screenshot approach captures the visible canvas as PNG, which involves internal PNG encoding overhead. For the SABDA resolution (6928×2400), this means ~6 seconds per frame vs ~0.22 seconds with direct readPixels + OffscreenCanvas JPEG. For a 54,000-frame render, that’s the difference between 3.3 hours and 90 hours.

45. **(v9) Preview mode (30× speed, 60-second output) validates the full pipeline in ~7 minutes.** Always run preview before committing to a 3+ hour full render. Preview mode advances the scene clock at 30× real-time, producing 1,800 frames that compress a 30-minute scene into 60 seconds. This catches: black frames (MSAA issue), incorrect colours, broken animations, encoding errors, and FFmpeg configuration problems — all in 7 minutes instead of 3.3 hours.

46. **(v9) CRF 14 vs CRF 18: 50-70% larger files but preserves subtle sky gradients and particle detail.** CRF 18 is visually acceptable on a laptop screen but introduces visible banding in subtle sky gradients when projected onto 15m walls from 1-3m viewing distance. CRF 14 preserves all gradient detail and is non-negotiable for SABDA production quality. File size increase (~2-3 GB per strip vs ~1.5 GB) is trivial compared to the quality improvement.

47. **(v9) Base64 transfer overhead (readPixels → JPEG → base64 → Node.js) is the pipeline bottleneck at 0.22s/frame.** This is acceptable for SABDA’s resolution and frame count. Optimising further would require native Node.js canvas bindings (node-canvas or sharp) to avoid the base64 serialisation step, but the complexity isn’t justified given the current 3.3-hour full render time.

48. **(v9) The transition from live HTML to pre-rendered video is the correct production path.** Live Chromium → Spout → Watchout works for development but risks frame drops during classes. Pre-rendered video guarantees frame-perfect playback every time, can be prepared overnight, and allows quality validation before the class starts. The rendering pipeline adds ~3.3 hours of preparation time but eliminates all runtime risk.

49. **(v9) Removing MSAA from wall render targets does not visibly degrade quality.** The content scene renders through the CubeCamera (which retains its quality settings) and the equirect shader (which has dithering). The wall render targets are simply capturing the room scene’s final composite, where MSAA’s edge smoothing is imperceptible at projection scale. Removing MSAA for readPixels compatibility has zero visual cost.

### v10 Additions: Loop Continuity & Workflow

50. **(v10) Pre-rendered video loops require ALL animated elements to align at the loop boundary.** Mathematical cycles (sky rotation, warmth, colour hue) naturally align if their periods divide evenly into 1800s. But stateful elements (bird positions via heading drift, dust particles via random respawn, planet rotations via incremental += dt) accumulate drift that creates visible jumps at the loop point. Each stateful element needs either time-absolute positioning (planets) or gentle homing blends near the boundary (birds, dust, colour lerp). Shooting stars need suppression in the last 15s to prevent mid-streak cuts.

51. **(v10) Homing blends must be gentle and bidirectional.** Birds need 30 seconds of 5%-per-frame homing on BOTH sides of the loop boundary (last 30s + first 30s). If homing is only applied before the cut, the first 30s after the cut shows birds suddenly released from homing, creating a different kind of visible discontinuity. The blend factor ramps 0 to 1 approaching the boundary and 1 to 0 leaving it, creating a smooth position match.

52. **(v10) Large HTML files (50MB+) must NEVER be uploaded as chat chunks.** Uploading 51MB of HTML chunks into a Claude chat alongside project files (1300+ lines of manual) immediately exhausts the context window, triggering compaction before the agent can even begin work. The solution is GitHub: store HTML files in a private repo (`github.com/marv0611/sabda`), clone via `git clone` at session start. This puts the file on disk without using any context. github.com is in the allowed network domains. raw.githubusercontent.com is blocked, so always use full `git clone`, not curl.

### v11 Additions: Render Architecture, Loop Check, Bird Fix, Context Optimization

53. **(v11) Render-only HTML is a separate file from the interactive viewer.** The render pipeline uses a dedicated lean HTML (~740 lines) with `antialias: false`, `UnsignedByteType`, no bloom, no orbit controls, no room scene, no strip RT, no MSAA. It exposes `SABDA_RENDER_FRAME` with all scene update logic inline. Never try to bolt render hooks onto the interactive viewer HTML — it's 10-25× slower due to the strip RT, MSAA, bloom, and rAF loop overhead. These are two separate files serving different purposes: the interactive viewer (antialias, bloom, MSAA, orbit controls, room scene) is for browser preview; the render HTML (antialias false, UnsignedByteType, no bloom, no room, direct per-wall equirect) is for Puppeteer rendering. Any attempt to unify them with URL parameters or mode flags creates the exact 25× slowdown that was debugged for 3 hours.

54. **(v11) Always commit working files to the repo immediately.** A 3-hour debugging session happened because the working render HTML was never committed. When a new chat started, only the interactive viewer HTML was in the repo, and the agent had to re-derive the render HTML from scratch — incorrectly. Rule: after any successful render run, immediately `git add -A && git commit -m "working render" && git push`. This is non-negotiable.

55. **(v11) Preview mode cannot validate dt-dependent elements.** Preview (30× speed) advances scene time by `sceneTimePerFrame = 1.0` per frame, but `dt` stays hardcoded at `1/30`. Any physics or animation using `dt` (birds, dust, shooting stars) runs at 1/30th real speed relative to scene time. Preview only validates time-absolute elements: sky rotation, warmth cycle, planet positions, colour cycling. This is not a bug — it's a known limitation of the preview architecture. Do not waste time trying to "fix" bird movement in preview mode.

56. **(v11) Loop check renderer verifies loop continuity.** Use `render_loopcheck.js` to verify loop continuity — it renders the last 15 seconds (t=1785→1800) followed by the first 15 seconds (t=0→15) at real-time speed. The loop point is at the 15-second mark of the output video. No warmup is needed because homing fixes bring birds/dust to spawn positions near boundaries regardless of accumulated state. Always run the loop check after modifying any animation that has state near the boundary.

57. **(v11) Bird homing must nudge position, not steer heading.** The original homing implementation (v10 Fix 3) steered bird heading toward a rotating `homeAngle` at 5% per frame. This overpowered the birds' natural flight drift and caused them to orbit their spawn position in tight circles — especially visible in the loopcheck where 100% of the rendered time is homing zone. The fix replaces heading-steering with gentle radial position nudging: `distErr * birdResetBlend * 0.003` moves the bird toward `homeDist` from centre, and a matching height nudge moves it toward `homeY`. The existing boundary steering (line 691, `dist > homeDist + 5`) handles angular distribution naturally. Birds now fly with natural drift during homing instead of circling.

58. **(v11) Loopcheck only shows homing time — behaviour looks worse than reality.** The loopcheck renders t=1770→1800 + t=0→30, which is 100% inside the homing zone. Any issues with homing (circular orbits, unnatural steering) are maximally visible in loopcheck output. In the actual 30-minute video, homing only runs for 60 seconds out of 1800 (3.3% of total time). If birds look slightly constrained in loopcheck but not visibly circular, that's acceptable.

59. **(v11) Chrome launch args matter for render performance.** The Puppeteer renderer uses `--use-gl=angle` and `--enable-webgl` with `--ignore-gpu-blocklist` for GPU access. The viewport size is set to 6928×2400 (the composite output resolution). These args are critical — without `--use-gl=angle`, Chrome may fall back to software rendering, which is orders of magnitude slower.

60. **(v11) Context window management is a production constraint.** The Claude Project File loads into EVERY message. A bloated project file (4K+ tokens of tables) + pasted conversation transcripts + full manual reads = conversation dies after 3-4 messages. Fix: slim project file (~800 tokens), no transcript pasting (use Claude's past-chat search tools), targeted manual section reads only. See Section 23.

61. **(v11.1) Dual-sky crossfade must use single sphere + ShaderMaterial.** Two sky spheres with transparency = 256MB VRAM + lag. A single sphere with a custom fragment shader mixing two textures via `mix(a.rgb, b.rgb, mixVal)` achieves the same result at negligible cost. The `mixVal` uniform is driven by `1.0 - warmth` so warm peak = sky A (Evening), cool peak = sky B (Belfast). Include dithering in the fragment shader to prevent banding at blend boundaries. The vertex shader must use standard `projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0)` — not the flat quad `vec4(position.xy, 0.0, 1.0)` used by equirect wall shaders.

62. **(v11.1) When replacing MeshBasicMaterial with ShaderMaterial, update all property access.** `MeshBasicMaterial` has `.color` for tinting; `ShaderMaterial` does not. After converting the sky sphere to ShaderMaterial, all `.color.setRGB()` calls in the render loop must change to `.uniforms.tintColor.value.setRGB()`. Missing this causes silent black rendering.

63. **(v11.1) Bird loop homing is a dead end — use fade-out/fade-in instead.** Three iterations of position/heading homing all failed: (a) per-frame 0.08 fractional blend never reaches target, (b) smoothstep time-absolute blend with 30s window freezes birds in place for too long, (c) tight 8s window causes visible retracing. The correct solution: scale birds to 0 over the last 8 seconds, silently reset positions at t=0, scale back up over the first 8 seconds. No homing math, no unnatural movement. Birds fly naturally for 29:44 of the 30-minute loop.

64. **(v11.1) Planet animation loops require integer cycle alignment.** If a GLB model has animations played via `AnimationMixer.setTime()`, the animation time at t=1800 must exactly equal t=0. Calculate: `nCycles = Math.round(totalAnimTime / clipDuration)`, then `loopAnimTime = nCycles * clipDuration`. Use `setTime(((time % 1800) / 1800) * loopAnimTime)`. Also: if `action.timeScale` was set during setup AND `setTime()` is used in the render loop, the speed is double-applied. Set `timeScale = 1` and control speed entirely via `setTime()` math.

65. **(v11.1) The slim HTML file needs a live preview loop for browser testing.** The render HTML only exposes `SABDA_RENDER_FRAME()` for Puppeteer — opening it directly shows a black screen. Add a live preview fallback gated by `if (!window.__SABDA_PUPPETEER__)` that calls `SABDA_RENDER_FRAME(liveT)` + `renderer.render(compScene, compCam)` via `requestAnimationFrame`. Include a time scrub slider (0–1800s) with play/pause, warmth/mix readout, and sky label. This is essential for rapid visual iteration without running the full render pipeline.

66. **(v11.1) Headless Chrome on Mac requires ANGLE/Metal for WebGL.** The default `--use-gl=egl` flag fails on macOS with "WebGL context could not be created". Use: `--use-gl=angle --use-angle=metal --ignore-gpu-blocklist --enable-gpu`. Without these, Chrome falls back to software rendering (no WebGL at all).

67. **(v11.1) Puppeteer page load: use domcontentloaded, not networkidle0.** With base64-embedded assets (two 8K sky textures = 27MB), `networkidle0` hangs waiting for data URL "network" activity to settle. Use `waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'` for page load, then `waitForFunction(() => window.SABDA_READY === true)` to confirm all assets have loaded via the `checkReady()` counter.

68. **(v11.1) Assembly script must handle cross-scene assets.** When crossfading between two scenes' skies, the assembly script needs to pull assets from a different scene's asset folder. The Evening scene's `assemble_evening.py` injects `skydata_b` from `assets_belfast/skydata.b64`. Each new cross-scene asset needs: (a) a `<script id="...">ASSET_PLACEHOLDER</script>` tag in the slim HTML, (b) a corresponding entry in the assembly script with the correct source path.

69. **(v11.1) Bird rotation: don't add Math.PI to heading.** The bird GLB model's default forward is -Z. Setting `rotation.y = heading` aligns the model with travel direction. Adding `+ Math.PI` flips it 180° — birds fly backward. This was a pre-existing bug discovered via screenshot inspection. Rule: always verify model facing direction before assuming a rotation offset is needed.

70. **(v11.1) Fly-out-above for bird loop boundaries is a dead end.** Three approaches failed: (a) smoothstep position.y override — birds cluster and rocket upward together, (b) lift force — birds accelerate unnaturally, (c) vy pull toward target — birds drop vertically. Any direct position.y manipulation during boundary fights the natural flight and looks wrong. The working solution is staggered fade: each bird gets `_fadeOffset = index * 1.3s`, fades out individually over 4s, resets position at t=0, fades in individually. No position manipulation, birds fly naturally throughout.

71. **(v11.1) Shooting stars must be shader quads, not sphere+cylinder.** Real meteors appear as thin bright streaks, not glowing balls. Replace SphereGeometry head + CylinderGeometry tail with a single PlaneGeometry + ShaderMaterial. Fragment shader: bright head at uv.y=1 fading to transparent tail at uv.y=0, thin center line via `pow(1 - abs(uv.x - 0.5) * 2, 3)`. Billboard toward camera with `lookAt(0,0,0)`, rotate to align with velocity.

72. **(v11.1) Shooting star entry angle: 20-45° from horizontal.** Setting entry angle to 60-80° makes meteors fall nearly vertically — this never happens in reality. Real meteors enter the atmosphere at shallow angles (20-45° below horizontal), creating the characteristic diagonal streak. Always reference real footage before setting physics parameters.

73. **(v11.1) Don't over-engineer natural phenomena — study reference first.** A "realistic meteor physics" rewrite with deceleration, gravity arcs, and brightness curves produced worse results than the simple straight-line approach with correct entry angle and a longer tail. The simple version looked more like the reference gif. Complexity ≠ realism. Match the visual reference, not the physics textbook.

74. **(v11.1) Shooting star frequency for wellness: ~30s average.** Original 6-14s interval was too frequent for a meditative environment. Set to `timer = 25 + Math.random() * 10` for 25-35s gaps (avg 30s). Initial spawn timer 8s for testing convenience.

---

75. **(v11.5) Shooting stars must follow the sky dome curvature, not fly in straight lines.** A straight-line velocity causes the meteor to leave the dome surface and become invisible. Re-project the position onto the dome each frame with `pos.normalize().multiplyScalar(340)`. Use Rodrigues rotation for the tail arc. This single change is what makes wall-crossing shooting stars possible.

76. **(v11.5) 50/50 size mix creates the best shooting star variety.** All-large shooting stars feel heavy and unnatural. All-small ones are underwhelming. A 50/50 split — half modest streaks (12-20 degree arc), half giant wall-crossers (46-115 degree arc) — creates a natural and surprising distribution where occasional massive streaks feel special.

77. **(v11.5) Bird turn rate must scale with timeScale.** At 30x timelapse, birds move 30x faster per frame but the turn rate clamp was fixed at 0.03 rad. Birds couldn't steer fast enough and flew out of the scene. Fix: maxTurn = 0.012 * dt * 30. This is the kind of bug that only appears in timelapse mode and looks fine at normal speed.

78. **(v11.5) Bird home-pull must be gentle — 0.004 base, not 0.015.** Aggressive home-pull (0.015) causes all birds to do synchronized sharp U-turns at the edge of their home zone. At 0.004, they make wide lazy arcs — like real birds riding thermals. The birds should barely seem to be correcting course.

79. **(v11.5) Hard teleport is better than heading-snap for escaped birds.** When a bird crosses dist > 40, snapping its heading inward doesn't work — it's already moving too fast, oscillates at the boundary. Instead, teleport it to a random point on its home orbit with a tangential heading. At dist > 40 it's offscreen anyway — the teleport is invisible.

80. **(v11.5) Bird model direction varies by viewing distance.** The same bird model can look like it's flying forward from far away but clearly backward from close up. Fix: flip rotation 180 degrees for close birds (dist <= 22), keep original for far birds (dist >= 28), smooth blend in the transition zone. Don't flip all birds — the backward look works fine at distance.

81. **(v11.5) Organic flapping requires slow transitions and sinusoidal modulation.** The lerp rate between glide and flap states is the biggest factor. At 1.5 (fast), the switch is mechanical. At 0.4 (slow), wings ease in and out naturally. Adding a per-bird sinusoidal wave (sin(time * unique_freq) * 0.12) prevents flapping from ever being perfectly constant — real birds never flap at a fixed rate.

82. **(v11.5) Projection optimization must be applied ONCE at the output shader only.** Applying S-curve contrast to both the sky sphere shader and the equirect output shader doubles the effect — darks crush to black, highlights clip. The filmic look comes from applying it once at the very end of the pipeline, where it affects all content equally.

83. **(v11.5) Filmic shoulder (1-exp(-x*k)) fights S-curve contrast.** The S-curve adds punch by deepening darks and brightening brights. The exponential shoulder then compresses everything back toward the middle. Result: all the contrast work is undone. Use a simple soft ceiling instead: min(col, 0.85 + (col - 0.85) * 0.3) — only compresses above 85%, leaves everything else alone.

84. **(v11.5) Projected content needs ~15% lower overall brightness than monitor content.** Projectors in a dark room amplify perceived brightness. Exposure, sun intensity, ambient, and fog color all need to come down. But reduce them evenly — don't just drop exposure, as that changes the tone mapping curve. Adjust each lighting component independently.

85. **(v11.5) Variable declaration order matters in spawn blocks.** If isGiant is used in maxLife calculation but declared after it, the entire render loop crashes silently. Always declare spawn-time variables at the top of the spawn block before any code that references them.

86. **(v11.5) Timelapse mode reveals physics bugs that normal speed hides.** At 1x speed, a bird with insufficient turn rate correction slowly drifts outward over 10 minutes — barely noticeable. At 30x, the same bird flies out of the scene in 20 seconds. Always test new physics at both normal and timelapse speed.

### v12 Additions: Room Testing & Visual Polish (March 2026)

87. **(v12) Shooting star movement: NEVER use spherical coordinates (theta/phi).** Spherical-coord trajectory creates rigid straight lines that look unnatural. The original Cartesian velocity (`pos.addScaledVector(vel, dt)`) + dome re-projection (`pos.normalize().multiplyScalar(340)`) creates a natural curved arc as the star falls. Keep Cartesian movement always.

88. **(v12) Shooting star wall crossing: multi-segment geometry, not flat quad.** A single flat quad (2 triangles) kinks at wall boundaries because the quad stretches across the projection seam. A 12-segment triangle strip follows the dome curvature smoothly — each segment is small enough to approximate the curve without visible kinking. Keep the original Cartesian physics, just replace the rendering geometry.

89. **(v12) Shooting star entry angle: 2-7° from horizontal, speed 120-200.** These values were tested in the room and looked good. Attempts to make stars "fall from above" (vertical dominant, 60-90°) made them nearly invisible — they traverse too little horizontal distance. Attempts at 15-30° looked mechanical. The 2-7° range creates the classic shallow sweeping streak.

90. **(v12) Bird scale must NEVER be multiplied by a fade factor.** Any system that scales birds toward zero at boundaries causes visible "evaporation" — birds shrink and vanish unnaturally. Birds must maintain constant distance-compensated scale at all times.

91. **(v12) Bird visibility must NEVER be toggled.** Setting `visible = false` at any point causes pop-in/pop-out artifacts. Birds must be `visible = true` at all times, repositioned only when they naturally exit the far edge (dist > 42) where they're already tiny.

92. **(v12) Bird loop boundary fade is a dead end — remove entirely.** Three iterations of loop fade systems all failed: (a) scale fade = evaporation, (b) visibility toggle = pop in/out, (c) spatial fly-in-from-below = unnatural. The working solution: no loop boundary handling at all. Birds fly continuously, reposition when they exit the scene edge. The 30-min loop seam has a tiny position discontinuity but birds are small and distant — unnoticeable.

93. **(v12) Bird homing forces cause circular orbiting.** Any boundary steering that curves birds back toward a "home distance" creates visible orbiting patterns. The fix: zero homing, zero boundary steering. Birds fly in straight lines (90% dead straight, 10% barely perceptible drift), exit one side, reappear at the opposite edge. Turn rate capped at 0.001 rad/s, steering response 0.03.

94. **(v12) Bird entry direction: 70% horizontal, 30% front-to-back.** Horizontal traversals (tangent to scene circle = left-to-right across horizon) look most natural, like birds crossing the sky over ocean. Front-to-back adds variety. Pure front-to-back only looks monotonous.

95. **(v12) Variable scope: shared constants must be at module scope.** `BIRD_REF_DIST` was declared inside an async GLTFLoader callback but referenced in the render function — ReferenceError crashed the animation loop silently. Any constant used in the render loop must be declared at module scope, never inside callbacks.

96. **(v12) Never use non-uniform scale on a rotating group.** Setting `scale.set(10.5, 13.5, 13.5)` on a group that rotates around Y causes the compressed X axis to rotate, making the object wobble between wide and narrow throughout the cycle. Always use uniform `setScalar()` on rotating groups.

97. **(v12) When removing a scene object, grep ALL references.** The Saturn Star removal required deleting: (a) the group creation, (b) the loader's `group.add()` call, (c) the render loop's `group.rotation.y` update, (d) the cloned mesh code. Missing any one crashes the scene. Always run `grep -n "objectName" file.html` before committing.

98. **(v12) S-curve contrast ≤50% for projectors.** 80% crushes dark cloud areas into mud on projectors. 50% provides good contrast without destroying the dark tones that projectors already struggle to reproduce.

99. **(v12) Saturation boost 45% is the sweet spot.** 28% was too dull (no pop on blues), higher than 50% risks oversaturation on warm tones. 45% works for both the vivid Belfast blues and the warm evening ambers.

100. **(v12) Cloud brightness lift must be aggressive for projection.** Lift 0.45, floor 0.10. What looks fine on a monitor looks dull and dark on projected walls. Dark cloud tint must include blue channel (R+G only = muddy brown; adding B shifts grays toward luminous lavender).

101. **(v12) Sky tint channels must stay above 0.85.** Anything lower visibly darkens the room. The tint should add colour character, never subtract brightness. Blue channel minimum 0.92 — suppressing blue during warm phase drains vividness from the entire scene.

102. **(v12) Don't bake projector edge blending into content.** Horizontal edge softening in the equirect shader created visible dark vertical bands at every wall boundary — worse than no treatment. Soft-edge blending between projectors is Watchout's job (Display > Soft Edge in Watchout stage editor). Content should be continuous and uniform edge-to-edge.

103. **(v12) Crossfade ratio: pow() biases the split.** `pow(warmthRaw, 2.0)` = 70/30 Belfast bias. Linear `warmthRaw` = 50/50. Don't apply pow() unless an intentional bias is wanted.

104. **(v12) Don't overwrite data arrays when editing nearby code.** Bird config arrays (`configs = [{angle, dist, y, scale}, ...]`) were accidentally replaced with uniform values when editing adjacent bird scaling code. Never touch data arrays unless explicitly asked to modify them.

105. **(v12) God rays: rose-tint for dreamy feel.** Original pure orange rays (`rgba(255,200,120)`) were too naturalistic. Shifting toward rose (`rgba(255,180,140)`) adds warmth and fantasy character while staying bright. The dreamy quality comes from colour richness, not from darkening.

106. **(v12) Dreamy atmosphere = richer tints at HIGH brightness, not darker.** The temptation is to add mood by darkening. In a projection room, darker = dull. Instead: push sky tint toward amber/magenta during warm phase, lavender/violet during cool phase, with all channels staying above 0.85. Add blue to fog and dust during cool phase. Rose-tint the ambient light. The result feels like a painted sky without losing any luminosity.

107. **(v12) Saturn has TWO groups — understand the model's internal units before touching either.** The Saturn GLB is ~1200 internal units. `saturnMainGroup` (scale 0.023) = 28 world units = the VISIBLE ringed Saturn. `saturnGroup` (scale 10) = 12,000 units = invisible (bigger than the 340-radius sky dome) — exists ONLY to hold a glow sprite. Scaling saturnMainGroup to 10 makes Saturn 12,000 units, wrapping around the entire scene invisibly. Never change Saturn scale without checking the model's internal unit size first. If removing the "UFO" glow dot, remove `saturnGroup` and keep `saturnMainGroup` — not the other way around.

108. **(v12) Sky phase offset controls cycle start position.** `skyPhase = ((time + OFFSET) / 1800) * Math.PI * 2` shifts where in the warmth cycle the visual begins. +300s = start in blue Belfast. Only affects warmth/crossfade — cloud drift, planets, birds stay at t=0. Simple way to control "what does the audience see first" without restructuring the timeline. Combined with `pow()` bias on warmthRaw, this gives full control over both the ratio and the starting point of the crossfade.

109. **(v12.1 — Murmuration) Watch the reference video BEFORE writing code.** 8 iterations were wasted tuning boids parameters blindly. The moment the reference video was studied frame-by-frame, the actual visual target became clear: a dark volumetric cloud with density variation, not scattered dots. Study first, code second.

110. **(v12.1 — Murmuration) Only plain THREE.Mesh renders through CubeCamera.** THREE.Points (custom shaders), InstancedMesh, and GPGPU texture readback all fail silently — objects are invisible or data returns zeros. Do not attempt these approaches. Each bird must be an individual Mesh added to contentScene.

111. **(v12.1 — Murmuration) Zero allocation in the per-bird simulation loop.** Array.push(), Array.sort(), object creation {j, d2}, and mesh.lookAt() all create garbage that causes visible stuttering at 600+ birds. Use pre-allocated Float32Array/Int32Array buffers, insertion sort into fixed slots, and Math.atan2/Math.asin for rotation.

112. **(v12.1 — Murmuration) Direct acceleration is the only physics model that works.** Normalization (Θ operator) kills directional diversity — alignment wins every frame. Inertia blending adds mushy lag. Direction-steering with turn limits causes jerkiness. Only `velocity += small_acceleration; clamp(speed)` gives crisp, responsive, organic movement.

113. **(v12.1 — Murmuration) Remove ALL equilibrium spacing forces.** Any spring, attraction zone, or cohesion toward neighbor center creates uniform crystal-lattice density. Real murmurations have massive density variation. Only collision avoidance (repel below 0.6-0.8 units) + center anchor. Let density be free.

114. **(v12.1 — Murmuration) Center pull must anchor to assigned position, not flock centroid.** In the SABDA scene (fixed camera), pulling toward the centroid lets the flock drift off screen. Pull each bird toward (0,0,0) in local coordinates = the flock's assigned world position. In standalone (camera follows), centroid pull is fine.

115. **(v12.1 — Murmuration) 2D pixel-space parameters don't transfer to 3D.** The Alex-Scott-NZ reference uses pixel units (maxSpeed 4, visualRange 35). Copying these to a 3D scene where the world is ~50 units produces chaos. Tune from scratch in the target coordinate system.

116. **(v12.1 — Murmuration) Edge perturbation must directly set velocity, not add force.** Forces get diluted by alignment before creating directional diversity. The initiator birds at the flock edge must have their velocity directly reassigned to a new direction. Alignment then propagates the turn through the rest of the flock naturally.

117. **(v12.1 — Murmuration) "Laggy" means architectural problem, not parameter problem.** Laggy = garbage collection stalls (allocation in hot loop) or inertia blending (smoothing layer). "Stuck together" = equilibrium spring or dominant alignment or strong center pull. Never try to fix these by tweaking numbers — the architecture must change.

118. **(v12.1 — Murmuration) Test at SABDA scene scale immediately.** The standalone test (camera follows flock at 40 units) looks completely different from the SABDA scene (flock at 20-35 units from fixed origin camera). Bird mesh size, speed, spread radius, anchor strength all need different values. Integrate after first working standalone, not after hours of standalone tuning.

119. **(v12.2 — Murmuration) Breathing rhythm must be ASYMMETRIC with near-zero expansion pull.** A symmetric sine wave oscillating pull ±50% is invisible. Real compress→stretch→compress requires: compress phase = strong pull (3-4× base), expand phase = nearly free (5% of base). The asymmetry creates dramatic density variation because during expansion birds fly freely and spread, then get yanked back during compression.

120. **(v12.2 — Murmuration) Dual-edge perturbation creates fork/split shapes.** Instead of always perturbing one edge, occasionally (20%) fire from both opposite edges with opposing turn angles. This creates the dramatic fork/split/ribbon shapes seen in real murmurations where the flock tears apart momentarily then reconnects. The opposing bird is found by reflecting the primary edge bird through the centroid.

121. **(v12.2 — Murmuration) Bird speed must scale with scene — SABDA birds were 2.5× too slow.** Standalone used speeds 0.2-0.5 producing dramatic stretching. SABDA initially used 0.08-0.20 — birds lacked momentum to stretch against even weak anchor pull. Increased to 0.12-0.30. Faster birds + weaker pull during expansion = actual visible breathing.

122. **(v12.3 — Murmuration) Agitation waves must propagate at finite speed, not instant.** The single biggest visual improvement. Instead of all birds in a patch turning simultaneously, a wave front advances outward from the initiator at ~0.8 units/frame. Birds are turned only when the wave front passes through them. This creates visible dark ripples rolling across the flock — the defining visual feature of real murmurations. Source: Hoetzlein "Flock2" (2024).

123. **(v12.3 — Murmuration) Per-bird response delay creates wave fronts.** When a bird is hit by a wave, it resists alignment for 8-20 frames. During this delay, the bird flies in its new direction while neighbors haven't yet responded. This temporal gap IS the visible wave front — a region where adjacent birds fly different directions, creating the density differential visible as a dark pulse. Source: Cavagna/Giardina PNAS 2012.

124. **(v12.3 — Murmuration) Cosine force blending eliminates jitter.** Hard cutoffs between separation and alignment zones cause visible jittering as birds rapidly switch between regimes. Smooth cosine interpolation (`0.5 - cos(pct * PI) * 0.5`) blends forces continuously. Source: Three.js GPGPU birds example.

125. **(v12.3 — Murmuration) Variable speed during turns creates natural density.** Birds turning hard decelerate, straight-flying birds accelerate. This emerges from real aerodynamics (banking costs energy). The visual result: inside of turns compresses (dark dense core), outside stretches (wispy edge). Implemented by measuring heading change per frame and modulating speed limits. Source: StarDisplay (Hildenbrandt/Hemelrijk).

126. **(v12.3 — Murmuration) Group tension tether prevents permanent splits.** Instead of strong center pull (which kills stretching), detect when flock extent exceeds a threshold and apply gentle elastic pull only to outermost birds. Allows dramatic 35+ unit ribbons and funnels while ensuring the flock always reconnects. Source: Alex Scott NZ murmuration reference.

122. **(v12.3 — Murmuration) Asymmetric breathing fixes the speed problem — don't need high speed.** With near-zero pull during expansion (5% of base), even 0.08-0.20 speed birds spread freely. The previous speed increase (0.12-0.30) was needed when breathing was symmetric ±50%. After implementing asymmetric breathing (compress=3.5×, expand=5%), speeds reduced back to 0.08-0.20 — still produces dramatic stretching because birds are essentially unanchored during expansion phase.

## 22. File Transfer: GitHub Workflow (v10)

### The Problem

SABDA HTML files are 48-52 MB (mostly base64-embedded assets). Uploading these as chat chunks exhausts the AI context window before work can begin, causing compaction loops and lost instructions. The manual itself (~1300 lines) plus HTML chunks leaves zero room for actual work.

### The Solution

Scene HTML files are stored in a GitHub repository. The agent clones the repo at the start of each session, getting all files on disk without using any context window space.

### Repository

- **URL:** `https://github.com/marv0611/sabda.git`
- **Type:** Private
- **Contents:** Scene HTML files, render scripts, output videos

### Agent Workflow (Every New Session)

```bash
cd /home/claude
git clone https://github.com/marv0611/sabda.git
ls -lh sabda/
```

This gives the agent the full HTML file on disk in seconds. No chunks, no uploads, no context used.

### User Workflow (Updating Files)

1. Copy updated HTML into the local `sabda` folder (managed by GitHub Desktop)
2. Open GitHub Desktop — it shows the changed files
3. Type a summary (e.g., "added render hooks") → Click **Commit to main**
4. Click **Push origin**

The next Claude session clones and gets the latest version automatically.

### What Goes in the Repo

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sabda_evening_render.html` | Current Evening Road scene — render-only HTML (loop-fixed, bird homing fixed) |
| `render.js` | Video rendering script — Puppeteer + FFmpeg (preview/full modes) |
| `render_loopcheck.js` | Loop boundary checker — renders last 15s + first 15s at real-time speed |
| `render_html_chunk_a*` | Split chunks of the render HTML (GitHub-friendly, `cat` to reconstruct) |
| Future scene HTMLs | New scenes as they're built |

### What Does NOT Go in the Repo

- The manual (stays as a Claude project file for always-available reference)
- Output videos (too large for GitHub, stay on local disk)
- Base64 asset files (.b64) — already embedded in the HTML

### Important Notes

- `raw.githubusercontent.com` is blocked — individual file downloads via curl won't work. Always use `git clone`.
- The repo is private — if auth is needed, provide a personal access token in the clone URL: `git clone https://TOKEN@github.com/marv0611/sabda.git`
- GitHub has a 100MB file size limit. SABDA HTMLs at 48-52MB are well within this.

---

## 23. Context Optimization Protocol (v11)

### The Problem

Claude conversations have a finite context window. Every token counts. The SABDA project is large — 75KB manual, 50MB HTML files, detailed parameter tables. If the project file (loaded on EVERY message) is bloated, conversations die after 3-4 exchanges.

### What Eats Context (Ranked)

1. **Pasted conversation transcripts** — BIGGEST killer. A single paste from a prior chat can be 30-40% of the budget. Claude has `conversation_search` and `recent_chats` tools — use those instead.
2. **Project file size** — Loaded into every single message. The old reference file was ~4K tokens of tables already in the manual. Trimmed to ~800 tokens in v2.
3. **Full manual reads** — `view` on the entire 75KB manual dumps it into context. Only read needed sections.
4. **Tool output echoing** — Git clone output, file listings, command results all accumulate. Summarize, don't echo.
5. **Long Claude responses** — Previous responses stay in context. Concise answers = more room for later messages.

### Rules for the User

- **Never paste transcripts from previous conversations.** Say "continue from [topic]" or "pick up where SKY9 left off" — Claude can search past chats.
- **Keep instructions concise.** Claude has memory of the project + can search past chats for details.
- **If hitting conversation limits:** Start a new chat. Don't try to push through — quality degrades as context fills.
- **One task per conversation** when possible. Don't overload a single chat with multiple unrelated changes.

### Rules for Claude

- Clone repo once at session start.
- Do NOT `view` the full manual. Read only the specific sections needed for the current task.
- Check memory first — don't re-read sections you already know.
- Minimize tool output in responses. Summarize results, don't echo raw output.
- Keep responses focused and concise. Avoid repeating what the user already knows.

### Lesson

> **Lesson 60: Context window management is a production constraint.** Treat it like render budget — every token has a cost. Slim project file + targeted manual reads + no transcript pasting = 3-4× longer conversations.

## 25. Projection Optimization Pipeline (v11.5)

### The Problem

Content that looks perfect on a monitor often looks poor when projected in the SABDA room:

1. **Washed-out colors** — projector stray light + room ambient desaturates the image
2. **White blowout patches** — bright areas become flat white blinding spots
3. **Black seams at projector overlaps** — doubled black level in blend zones creates dark stripes
4. **Color banding in gradients** — 8-bit quantization + projector gamma creates visible steps

### The Solution: Shader-Level Post-Processing

A projection optimization pipeline runs in the equirect output shader — the final stage before pixels hit the wall. This is the ONLY place to apply these corrections (not on the sky, not on the scene — only at output).

**Critical: apply corrections ONCE, at the output stage only.** Applying S-curve contrast to both the sky shader AND the output shader doubles the effect and crushes the image.

### The Pipeline (Order Matters)

```glsl
// 1. Black floor lift — raises minimum brightness
col.rgb = col.rgb * 0.97 + 0.015;

// 2. S-curve contrast — richer midtones
vec3 scurve = col.rgb * col.rgb * (3.0 - 2.0 * col.rgb);
col.rgb = mix(col.rgb, scurve, 0.80);

// 3. Saturation boost — compensates projector washout
float luma = dot(col.rgb, vec3(0.299, 0.587, 0.114));
col.rgb = mix(vec3(luma), col.rgb, 1.28);

// 4. Highlight ceiling — prevents white blowout
col.rgb = min(col.rgb, 0.85 + (col.rgb - 0.85) * 0.3);

// 5. Edge softening — helps projector blend zones
float edgeFade = smoothstep(0.0, 0.03, vUv.x) * smoothstep(1.0, 0.97, vUv.x);
float topBottomFade = smoothstep(0.0, 0.02, vUv.y) * smoothstep(1.0, 0.98, vUv.y);
col.rgb *= edgeFade * topBottomFade * 0.05 + 0.95;

// 6. Dither — prevents banding (always last)
col.rgb += dither(gl_FragCoord.xy) / 255.0;
```

### What Each Step Does

| Step | Purpose | Without It |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Black floor lift (1.5%) | Raises darkest pixels so projector overlap zones have minimal relative difference | Dark seams/patches where projectors overlap |
| S-curve contrast (80%) | Deepens darks, enriches midtones — counteracts projector ambient haze | Flat, washed-out image |
| Saturation boost (28%) | Pre-compensates for stray light mixing that desaturates the projected image | Pastel, lifeless colors |
| Highlight ceiling (85% + 30% compression) | Prevents bright areas from becoming flat white glare spots | Blinding white patches at sunset/horizon |
| Edge softening (3% horizontal, 2% vertical) | Reduces brightness at wall panel edges where projectors overlap | Visible bright seams at blend zones |
| Dither (plus/minus 0.5 LSB) | Breaks up 8-bit quantization bands in smooth gradients | Visible color stepping in sky |

### Tuning Guidelines

- Too washed out: Increase S-curve blend (0.80 to 0.90) and saturation (1.28 to 1.35)
- Too contrasty / pixelated: Decrease S-curve blend (0.80 to 0.60)
- White patches blinding: Lower highlight ceiling (0.85 to 0.80)
- Dark patches at overlaps: Increase black floor lift (0.015 to 0.025)
- Colors oversaturated: Decrease saturation (1.28 to 1.15)

### What Cannot Be Fixed from Content Side

The following issues require Watchout / projector calibration:

| Issue | Watchout Fix |
|-------|------------|
| Dark seams between projectors | Adjust edge blend width to match actual physical overlap |
| Uneven brightness across walls | Adjust per-projector brightness/gamma curves |
| Color mismatch between projectors | Calibrate white point per projector |
| Black level doubled in overlaps | Enable black level compensation in Watchout |
| Geometric misalignment | Re-run projector alignment / warping |

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Applying contrast to BOTH sky shader and output shader | Double S-curve crushes image | Apply ONLY at the output equirect shader |
| Using filmic shoulder (1-exp(-x*k)) after S-curve | The shoulder compresses everything back, eating the contrast | Use simple soft ceiling: min(col, 0.85 + (col - 0.85) * 0.3) |
| Too much saturation (>1.35) | Colors become neon, unnatural | Stay at 1.20-1.30 range |
| No highlight ceiling | Sunsets become flat white that is painful in a dark room | Always clamp highlights |
| Edge fade too aggressive (>8%) | Visible vignette on each wall panel | Keep at 3-5% |

### Lighting Parameter Adjustments for Projection

| Parameter | Monitor Value | Projection Value | Reduction |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| Tone mapping exposure | 0.92 + b*0.18 | 0.82 + b*0.14 | ~12% |
| Hemisphere intensity | 0.38 + b*0.10 | 0.32 + b*0.08 | ~16% |
| Sun intensity | 0.55 + w*0.50 + b*0.12 | 0.45 + w*0.40 + b*0.10 | ~18% |
| Ambient intensity | 0.34 + w*0.12 + b*0.08 | 0.28 + w*0.10 + b*0.06 | ~18% |
| Fog color RGB | 0.55/0.43/0.52 | 0.45/0.36/0.44 | ~15% |
| Color saturation (HSL) | 0.58, L 0.50 | 0.62, L 0.44 | More saturated, darker |

Projectors in a dark room amplify perceived brightness. What looks balanced on a monitor is too bright when projected on 4 walls around you.

## 26. Timelapse Testing Mode (v11.5)

Press **T** to toggle 30x speed — 30 minutes compresses to 1 minute for rapid testing of:
- Bird movement patterns over the full cycle
- Loop boundary transitions
- Sky warmth cycle progression
- Shooting star variety

### Implementation

```javascript
let timeScale = 1;
document.addEventListener('keydown', e => {
  if (e.key === 'T' || e.key === 't') timeScale = timeScale === 1 ? 30 : 1;
});
// In render loop:
const dt = (1/30) * timeScale;
```

### Critical: All Physics Must Scale with dt

Any physics that doesn't scale with dt will break at 30x:

| Element | Must scale | How |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Bird horizontal movement | Yes | cruiseSpeed * dt * 30 |
| Bird vertical spring | Yes | vy += force * dt |
| Bird damping | Yes | Math.pow(0.96, dt * 30) |
| Bird turn rate clamp | Yes | maxTurn = 0.012 * dt * 30 |
| Bird flap animation | Cap it | Math.min(timeScale, baseTimeScale * 2) — wings don't go insane |
| Shooting star life | Yes | ss.life -= dt |
| Home-pull steering | Yes | inherits through dt |

### Info Bar Display

When timelapse is active, show a lightning bolt 30x indicator in red on the info overlay so it's obvious the scene is accelerated.

## 24. Archived Reference Data (Moved from Project File v1)

Wall B = planet side. Wall D = Saturn side.

## 27. Two-Screen Render Preview Template (v11.5)

### Overview

`sabda_template_slim.html` is a reusable framework for any SABDA scene. It provides the complete Watchout-compatible dual-strip rendering pipeline — 4-wall equirectangular projection, live browser preview with time scrubbing, and Puppeteer headless rendering interface — without any scene-specific content.

**What the template provides (you don't touch these):**
- Wall dimensions: Left/Right 5008×1200, Front/Back 1920×1200
- Room geometry and azimuth mapping (41.26m perimeter)
- WebGLRenderer at 6928×2400
- CubeCamera (4096px) at eye height (1.6m)
- 4 wall render targets with equirect projection shader (contrast, saturation, dithering)
- Composite scene blitting 4 walls into dual-strip layout
- Guide overlays with wall labels (toggle D key)
- Puppeteer interface: `SABDA_RENDERER`, `SABDA_WALLS`, `SABDA_RENDER_FRAME()`
- Live preview: time slider (0-1800s), play/pause, T for 30× timelapse, FPS counter

**What you fill in (6 insertion points):**

| Placeholder | What to put there |
|---|---|
| `SCENE_ASSETS_HERE` | `<script id="..." type="text/plain">ASSET_PLACEHOLDER</script>` tags for each base64 asset |
| `SCENE_IMPORTS_HERE` | Extra Three.js imports (GLTFLoader, DRACOLoader, SkeletonUtils, etc.) |
| `SCENE_CONSTANTS_HERE` | Scene-specific constants (BREATH, CCYCLE, sky colours, etc.) |
| `SCENE_CONTENT_HERE` | All meshes, lights, particles, loaders added to `contentScene` |
| `SCENE_ANIMATION_HERE` | `window.SABDA_UPDATE_SCENE(time, dt)` — all per-frame animation |
| `SCENE_STATUS_FN` | `window.SABDA_STATUS(time)` — returns HUD string (e.g. "warmth=0.42") |

### How to create a new scene

```bash
# 1. Copy template
cp sabda_template_slim.html sabda_SCENENAME_render_slim.html

# 2. Edit the file — fill in the 6 placeholder sections
#    Search for "SCENE_" to find each insertion point

# 3. Create assets directory and assemble script
mkdir assets_SCENENAME
cp assemble_evening.py assemble_SCENENAME.py
# Edit assemble_SCENENAME.py: change paths, asset IDs

# 4. Assemble and test
python3 assemble_SCENENAME.py
# Open sabda_SCENENAME_render_full.html in Chrome
# Use time slider, T key for timelapse, D for guides

# 5. Render preview (60s output, ~7 min)
# Edit render.js to point at new HTML filename
node render.js

# 6. Full render (30min output, ~3-5 hours)
node render.js full
```

### Available objects in scene content section

| Object | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `contentScene` | THREE.Scene | Add all meshes, lights, particles here |
| `renderer` | THREE.WebGLRenderer | For creating textures, custom RTs |
| `EYE_H` | Number (1.6) | Camera height in metres |
| `cubeCamera` | THREE.CubeCamera | At (0, EYE_H, 0) — don't move |
| `b64T(id, mapping)` | Function | Load `<script id="...">` as THREE.Texture |

### Keyboard shortcuts (live preview)

| Key | Action |

### Compatibility with render.js

The template exposes the same interface render.js expects:
- `window.__SABDA_PUPPETEER__` — set by render.js to skip live preview
- `window.SABDA_RENDER_FRAME(simTime, speedMultiplier)` — advance + render one frame
- `window.SABDA_RENDERER` — the WebGLRenderer for readPixels
- `window.SABDA_WALLS` — `{ left, right, front, back }` render targets

No changes to render.js needed — just update the HTML filename it opens.

## 28. Murmuration System (v12)

### Overview

Starling murmuration flocks integrated into the SABDA 360° scene. Each flock is a group of individual `THREE.Mesh` birds running a boids-style simulation with topological 7-nearest-neighbor interactions. The visual target is the dense, shape-shifting cloud seen in real starling murmurations — not scattered dots.

**Current state:** v17 with five behavioral upgrades — agitation wave propagation, per-bird response delay, cosine force blending, variable speed during turns, group tension tether. 2 flocks × 600 birds, speeds 0.10-0.28, separated 180° apart. Standalone: `murmuration_standalone.html`. Integrated: `sabda_murmuration_slim.html` via `assemble_murmuration.py`.

---

### 28.1 Rendering Constraints

**What renders through CubeCamera:** Plain `THREE.Mesh` objects added to `contentScene`. Each bird is an individual mesh.

**What does NOT render through CubeCamera (do not attempt):**
- `THREE.Points` with custom shaders — invisible through CubeCamera
- `InstancedMesh` — invisible through CubeCamera
- GPGPU texture readback (`readRenderTargetPixels` with FloatType) — returns zeros silently

**Practical bird count limit:** ~600-800 per flock before frame rate degrades. Performance must be managed through code optimization, not rendering tricks.

---

### 28.2 Performance: Zero-Allocation Hot Loop

The neighbor-finding loop runs for every bird every frame. With 600 birds at 60fps = 36,000+ calls/second. ANY allocation in this loop causes garbage collector stalls → visible stuttering the user calls "laggy."

**Causes of lagginess (confirmed through testing):**
- `Array.push()` and `Array.sort()` inside neighbor loop
- `Array.slice()` for top-K selection
- Creating `{j, d2}` objects per candidate
- `mesh.lookAt()` (internally creates temporary Matrix4, Vector3, Quaternion)

**Required approach:**
- Pre-allocated `Float32Array` / `Int32Array` for ALL buffers (positions, velocities, neighbor indices, neighbor distances, nearby cell results)
- Insertion sort into fixed 7-slot typed array buffer (not full sort + slice)
- `Math.atan2` + `Math.asin` for mesh rotation (not `lookAt()`)
- Spatial hash grid with `Map` of arrays (grid rebuilds once per frame, acceptable)

**Rule:** If it allocates inside the per-bird loop, it will stutter. No exceptions.

---

### 28.3 Physics Model: Direct Acceleration

After testing normalization (PNAS Eq 9), inertia blending, direction-steering, and direct acceleration — only direct acceleration produces crisp, responsive, non-laggy movement.

**The model:**
```
velocity += acceleration    // forces are small accelerations
clamp(speed, MIN, MAX)      // prevent freeze or explosion
position += velocity        // move
```

No normalization operator. No inertia blending parameter. No momentum accumulator. Velocity persists naturally between frames (Newton's first law). A bird turned by a perturbation keeps flying that direction until forces gradually bend it back. This allows different parts of the flock to fly different directions simultaneously → stretching, density variation, shape-shifting.

**Why other approaches failed:**

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Θ normalization (PNAS Eq 9) | Direction recomputed from scratch each frame → alignment always wins → rigid blob, no spreading |
| High inertia blending (0.95-0.985) | Extra smoothing layer → laggy, mushy, unresponsive movement |
| Direction-steering with turn rate limit | Capped at ~1.4°/frame → jerky, choppy, birds barely respond |

**Key insight:** "High inertia" in boids is NOT a code parameter — it's an emergent property of small accelerations on persistent velocity. Don't implement inertia. It happens because `velocity += tiny_force` naturally preserves most of the old direction.

---

### 28.4 Force Balance

Only three forces produce good results. Everything else was harmful or redundant.

**Alignment (0.05-0.08):** `acceleration += (avg_neighbor_velocity - my_velocity) * strength`. Steer toward average velocity of 7 nearest topological neighbors. This IS the turning wave propagation mechanism. Too strong → rigid blob. Too weak → flock dissolves.

**Collision avoidance (0.03 within 0.6-0.8 units):** Only repel when nearly colliding. No equilibrium distance. No attraction. Density must be FREE to vary.

**Center anchor (0.0004 × distance for SABDA scene):** The ONLY global cohesion force.
- In standalone (camera follows): pull toward flock centroid
- In SABDA scene (fixed camera): pull toward (0,0,0) in local coordinates = assigned world position

**Forces confirmed harmful — do not reintroduce:**

| Force | Why it fails |
|-------|-------------|
| Equilibrium spring / distance force | Creates uniform crystal-lattice spacing → kills density variation → stuck-together blob |
| Strong center pull (>0.002) | Yanks birds into tight ball before they can spread |
| Cohesion toward neighbor center | Redundant with alignment, increases stickiness |
| Predator avoidance | Causes circling artifacts |
| Waypoints | Causes circling |
| Speed matching between neighbors | Unnecessary with speed clamping |
| Momentum accumulator | Extra smoothing = extra lag |
| Flow fields | Marginal effect, adds code complexity |
| Information cascade / leader system | Overengineered, alignment already propagates turns |

---

### 28.5 Edge Perturbation: Source of Shape Changes

Real murmurations change shape because turning waves propagate with delay. The front turns while the back hasn't yet → funnel, stretch, split, ribbon. When the wave completes → compression. This is the "breathing."

**Implementation:**
- Every 0.4-1.5 seconds, find an edge bird (furthest from centroid, sampled from 30-50 random candidates)
- DIRECTLY SET velocity of a patch of birds (radius 4-10 around the edge bird) to a new direction (±60-90°)
- The patch turn must bypass normal forces — direct velocity assignment, not force addition
- Use quadratic falloff within the patch: `falloff = (1 - d/radius)²`
- Alignment then naturally propagates the turn through the rest of the flock over 2-5 seconds

**Critical:** Perturbation must DIRECTLY SET velocity, not add a force. Forces get diluted by alignment before creating real directional diversity.

### 28.6 Density Variation: No Equilibrium

The biggest visual gap between simulation and reality: real murmurations have massive density variation (dark dense cores, transparent wispy edges). Uniform spacing = crystal lattice ≠ fluid.

**Rule:** Remove ALL inter-bird attraction. Only collision avoidance below 0.6-0.8 units. Density variation emerges from flow convergence/divergence during turning waves. Where flows converge → dense core. Where flows diverge → wispy edge.

### 28.7 2D Reference Parameters Do Not Transfer to 3D

The Alex-Scott-NZ Murmuration reference runs in 2D pixel space (1920×1080). Its default parameters:
```
separation: 0.08, alignment: 0.15, cohesion: 0.003
noiseIntensity: 0.5, maxSpeed: 4, minSpeed: 2
visualRange: 35, protectedRange: 8, centerAttraction: 0.0
groupTension: 0.5
```

These are in PIXELS. Copying them to a 3D scene where the world is ~50 units produces chaos. Divide speeds by 10-20, distances by 5-10, or tune from scratch.

### 28.8 SABDA Scene Integration

**Anchor vs Follow:** In standalone the camera follows the flock. In SABDA the camera is fixed at origin. Center pull must anchor to the assigned world position, not the flock centroid (which drifts with the birds).

**Flock positioning:**
- Place centers at distance 15-25 from origin
- y = 4-8 (sky height, above horizon, below zenith)
- Front hemisphere (negative Z or mixed) so visible on primary walls
- Two large flocks > four small ones (more visual impact, more density layers)
- EYE_H = 1.6 in the scene — position flocks well above this

**Scale for SABDA scene:**
- Bird mesh: body 0.6 units long, wingspan 1.0 — visible at 20-30 unit distance
- Flock spread radius: 15-20 units — covers meaningful chunk of sky
- Speed: 0.08-0.20 per frame (with asymmetric breathing, don't need high speed)
- Center anchor pull: 0.0004 × distance (weak enough for 20+ unit spreading)

### 28.10 Visual Reference

Study these before any murmuration work:
- Fox Weather murmuration compilation (YouTube: X0sE10zUYyY)
- Lough Ennell / River Shannon murmuration footage
- Bialek, Cavagna, Giardina et al. "Statistical mechanics for natural flocks of birds" PNAS 2012

**Key visual observations from reference video (0:20-1:00):**
1. The mass is a DARK CLOUD — you almost can't see individual birds at distance. Semi-transparent, varying density.
2. Shape is predominantly FLAT — wider than tall. A horizontal disc that tilts, warps, stretches.
3. Dense leading edge, wispy trailing edge during turns.
4. The mass drifts SLOWLY, the shape morphs FASTER.
5. Funnel/tornado shapes form when a turning wave is mid-propagation (front turned, tail hasn't yet).
6. "Breathing" = wave completing its pass → compression → new wave → expansion.
7. Birds are less than a body-length apart in dense regions. Spacing under 1 unit.

---

### 28.11 Process Lessons

1. **Watch the reference video BEFORE writing code.** Study the visual target frame by frame. Understand what you're trying to make before touching parameters.
2. **Start with the simplest possible physics** (direct acceleration, 3 forces) and tune from there. Do not add complexity (personality traits, flow fields, information cascades, momentum accumulators) until the simple version works.
3. **Test at target scale immediately.** Integrate into SABDA scene after the first working standalone version. Don't tune standalone for hours then discover it doesn't work at scene scale.
4. **Performance test with target bird count from day one.** Build for 600+ birds with zero-alloc loop from the start. Don't optimize retroactively.
5. **When something is "laggy" or "stuck together" — the architecture is wrong, not the parameters.** Laggy = allocation in hot loop or inertia blending. Stuck = equilibrium spring or strong center pull or dominant alignment. Don't try to fix architectural problems by tweaking numbers.

**Ceiling projectors (the 8 that matter for visual output):**
- LEFT GROUP (0.8:1 lenses): PRO-07, PRO-01, PRO-06, PRO-02, PRO-05
- RIGHT GROUP (ET-ELU20 ultra-short): PRO-03, PRO-08, PRO-04

**Floor projectors (PRO-09 through PRO-14):** Floor projection, separate from wall visual.

### 29.5 Lens Boundary Implications

⚠️ **The boundary where content transitions from a 0.8:1 lens projector to an ET-ELU20 ultra-short throw projector can show visible differences:**
- Different brightness falloff patterns (UST spreads light very differently)
- Different edge sharpness characteristics
- Possible slight color temperature variation between lens types
- Different vignetting profiles

**This is a hardware reality that software cannot fully fix.** Watchout edge-blending calibration must account for the lens differences. However, the visual content can minimize visibility of these seams by:
1. Avoiding high-contrast horizontal gradients near the lens boundary
2. Keeping exposure and tint values conservative (never exceeding 1.0)
3. Using HalfFloat cubemap render targets (16-bit) to prevent banding
4. Adding subtle dithering to break up quantization artifacts

### 29.6 Rendering Pipeline — Projector-Safe Values

Values that work correctly on this projector setup (matched from evening scene):

| Parameter | Safe Value | Unsafe Value (causes seams) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| toneMappingExposure | 0.82 + b×0.14 (range 0.82–0.96) | 1.0 + b×0.18 (range 1.0–1.18) |
| Tint R | 0.94 + warmth×0.11 (max 1.05) | 0.98 + warmth×0.20 (max 1.18) |
| Tint G | 0.85 + warmth×0.10 (max 0.95) | 0.78 + warmth×0.15 (max 0.93) |
| Tint B | 0.92 + (1-warmth)×0.10 (max 1.02) | 0.90 + (1-warmth)×0.18 (max 1.08) |
| Sun intensity | 0.45 + warmth×0.40 + b×0.10 | 0.55 + warmth×0.50 + b×0.15 |
| CubeRT type | THREE.HalfFloatType (16-bit) | THREE.UnsignedByteType (8-bit = banding) |
| Dithering | 1.5/255 | 1.0/255 (may show banding) |

**Rule: Never exceed the evening scene's proven values.** The evening visual works perfectly on this exact hardware. Any new scene should match or stay below those levels.

### 29.7 3LCD-Specific Notes

The PT-MZ682 uses 3LCD technology (not DLP):
- **No color wheel** — no rainbow artifacts, good for immersive environments
- **Native contrast ~3,000:1** — the 3,000,000:1 spec is Dynamic Contrast (laser modulation)
- **Dark purple gradients are the hardest** — 3LCD's native contrast means very dark purples can band. This is why HalfFloat + dithering is critical.
- **Color uniformity is generally good** — no DLP color breakup, consistent across the panel
- **Laser source** means consistent brightness over time (no lamp degradation)

### 28.12 Next Steps

- [x] Tune density spread to match reference video — dramatic perturbations, asymmetric breathing, dual-edge splits (v16)
- [x] Enhance breathing rhythm — asymmetric compress/expand with near-zero expansion pull (v16)
- [ ] Replace triangle mesh with stylized 3D starling model
- [ ] Test 500+ birds per flock with current optimizations — may need WebWorker for sim
- [ ] Visual harmony with existing SABDA scene birds (old wing-flapping ones)
- [ ] Consider 2D canvas particle overlay for ultra-dense distant flocks (10,000+ particles as dark pixels on a texture plane)
- [ ] Verify v16 tuning in SABDA scene — check spread, breathing visible from fixed camera

## 30. Generic Pipeline Lessons

### 30.1 Never Toggle `visible` for Scene Enter/Exit

Setting `group.visible = false` then `true` causes instant pop-in — objects appear from nothing in a single frame. **Always use position-based hiding**: park the group at `y = -100` (below CubeCamera view) or `y = +100` (above). Let it physically rise/fall into the visible range. The CubeCamera can't see objects that far outside the projection, so they're effectively invisible without any jarring toggle.

### 30.2 Never Use Bash Heredoc to Embed Base64 in JS

Bash heredocs inject a stray newline character inside JavaScript string literals. This silently breaks the JS parser — no error message, just a black screen. **Always use Python** to build HTML files that contain embedded base64 strings. Python's string concatenation guarantees zero unwanted characters inside the string.

### 30.3 Always Check for Duplicate `const` Before Adding

Duplicate `const` declarations in JS modules cause an immediate silent crash — black screen, no console error. Before adding any new `const`, **always `grep` the file** for the variable name first. This is especially dangerous when refactoring code across sessions where earlier definitions may exist higher in the file.
